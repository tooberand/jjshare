Minnesota -- The Mountain Goats

I just tried to edit the existing tab, which was close to correct
but has a few problems.  The biggest thing is that it was missing 
the Am during the chorus part, and just had a C.  You can hear he
does a walkdown on the A string from C to Am. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

G Em   Seeds came in the mail today from Holland 
D C    and the Language on the package / is Wonderful and strange
G Em   All sorts of flowers / that Grow up from the earth
D C    _ in goodly colors / Gloriously arranged

C D    I circled the house and i Scattered them around
G C    let the Water sink down into the Soil
Am D   _ stared a long time at the Residue
G C    _ blood, milk and Oil
Am D   God the humidity is something
G C    Our shirts are soaked clean through
Am D   the House is throbbing and the Heat keeps coming
G C    And i keep looking at You

G Em Dsus C    

G Em   and then you're singing in dutch to me
D C    and i recognize the song
G Em   it seems so old and so fragile 
D C    and i haven't heard it in so long
Am D   we may throw the windows open later
G C    but we are not as far west as you suppose we are
Am D   hot wind coming off the water
G C    the sky gone crazy with stars
Am D   while we stay here we imagine we're alive
G C    we see shadows on the walls
Am D   there's something waiting for us in the hot, wet air
G C    sweat, water and alcohol

G D    just the old blood rising up through the wooden floor again
G C    just the old love asking for more again

GCDD   Here come the days of light and grace.
GCGEm  Here come the hours of wordless wondrousness.
GDGG   White light will fill this humble place.

When you come, the stars will shine brighter than spun gold.
When you come, the world will seem shiny and new.
My mom told me that someday someone like you would come to set things right.
'Til you come, I'll keep this place ready for you.

I saw them riding up the road.
And I swept and scrubbed the stable twice.
Filled it with golden yellow straw, sweet and clean.
I did my best to make things nice.

When you come, the stars will shine brighter than spun gold.
When you come, the world will seem shiny and new.
My mom told me that someday someone like you would come to set things right.
Until you come, I'll keep this place ready for you.

C#m G# A B   she came in on the redeye to dallas-fort worth. (1111)
E G# A B     all the way from sunny taipei. (1112)
C#m G# A B   skin the color of a walnut shell, (1111)
E G# A B     and a baseball cap holding down her black hair. (1112)
A A B B      and she came here after midnight. (2233)
E E A A      the hot weather made her feel right at home. (2222)
E E A A      come on in, we haven't slept for weeks. (2222)
E E A B      drink some of this. it'll put color in your cheeks. (2222)

C#m G# A B   he drove in from mexicali, no worse for wear.
E G# A B     money to burn, time to kill.
C#m G# A B   but five minutes looking in his eyes
E G# A B     and we all knew he was broken pretty bad, so we gave him what we
A A B B      had.  we cleared a space for him to sleep in, and we let the
E E A A      SIlence that's our trademark MAKE its presence felt.

E E A A      come on in, we haven't slept for weeks.
E E A B      drink some of this. it'll put color in your cheeks.

C#m G# A B (2222)
C#m G# A B (2222)
E E B B    (3322)

C#m G# A B   they came in by the dozens, walking or crawling.
E G# A B     some were bright-eyed.  some were dead on their feet.
C#m G# A B   and they came from zimbabwe,  or from soviet georgia.
E G# A B     east saint louis, or from paris, or they lived across the street.
A A B B      but they came, and when they'd FINALLY made it here,
E E A A      it was the least that we could do to make our welcome clear.

E E A A      come on in, we haven't slept for weeks.
E E A B      drink some of this. this'll put color in your cheeks.

Intro: G

G          C                G
The fog is lifting from the water.
    G         C               D     (Dsus4 D)
The bells are sounding on the boats.
   G    C         G                 Em
And our love is a monster plain and simple.
           G                  D                C
Though you weigh it down with stones to try to drown it,
   D
it floats.
   G
It floats.


G, riff


    G      C            G
The day of reckoning is coming
 G             C            D 
faster than anyone here realizes.
    G   C            G          Em 
And our love is like Jesus, but worse.
           G                D                   C 
Though you seal the cave up where you'd lain its body,
   D
it rises
   G   
It rises.


G, riff


G D C D G
I     
G                          D
keep waiting for our love to die.
      G             C            G             G/F#        Em
The machines by its bed dim and flicker, but it won't stay dead.
       G                 D                C          D
And it perks up when the nurses bring its medication by.


G D C D G
I       wish 
    G                            D
our love could go the way of all flesh.

Intro:  Riff x2

G       On the day that Dennis Brown's lung
C-D     collapsed / Spring rain was misting down on
RIFF    Kingston

G       And down at the harbor local
C-D     cops were intercepting an inbound
RIFF    shipment

C G     And for a while there it was chaos
C D     As they handcuffed and then ruffed up some sailors.
G       On the day my lung collapses
C-D     it's not gonna be that different.
RIFF    different

G     On the day that Dennis Brown's habits
C-D   caught up with him School children sang in
RIFF  choirs.

G     And out behind the Chinese
C-D   restaurants Guys were jumping into
RIFF  dumpsters

C G     And the stench was overbearing
C D     But they were past the point of caring.
G       On the day my habits catch up
C-D     with me, I'll be down among
RIFF    the jumpers.

G C-D   And when the birds come home in spring / We will fill them full of
RIFF    buckshot.


G C-D   And jets of contaminated blood Will cloud the rivers and
RIFF    the lakes.

C G      It took all the coke in town
C D      To bring down Dennis Brown.
G C-D    On the day my lung collapses, we'll see just how much it
RIFF     takes.

              there was a snap in the air

              and the new york sun brought out the highlights in your hair

Cool air comes through the venetian blinds
And the planets and the heavens are perfectly aligned
I take in my surroundings, I memorize them all
The scuff marks on the stone floor
The powder burns on the eastern wall

There's a monkey in the basement
Where did the monkey come from
There's a monkey in the basement
How did the monkey get there, how did the monkey get there
How did the monkey get there

The animal noises you used to make
The andalusian coral snake
All pale when standing beside this room
And the heavy hot rains and the sonic boom

Bring me something new that I haven't felt before
The messages of love and directions to you door
But please talk slowly, I don't hear good anymore
And we all Fall down
And we all Fall down  

Don't die on me lady, only good things can come 
To those who practice reason and recognize good fun
Your absence is the bullet and the past is your gun 
And we all fall down
And we all fall down

She still doesn't answer though she knows shes done wrong
We buried the memories along with the songs
When she wakes up, I hope that we are gone
And we all fall down
And we all fall down

There's a visitor in black at my neighbors house
My neighbor says tomorrow the visitor says now 
When he comes here please tell him that I'm out
And we all fall down
And we all fall down

Neutral Milk Hotel - The King of Carrot Flowers Pt. 1

F C Bb  (x2)

When you were young you were the king of carrot flowers
and how you built a tower tumbling through the trees
In holy rattlesnakes that fell all 'round your feet

and your mom would stick a fork right into daddy's shoulder
and dad would throw the garbage all across the floor
as we would lay and learn what each other's bodies were for 

F C Bb  (x2)

and this is the room one afternoon I knew I could love you
and from above you how I sank into your soul
into that secret place where no one dares to go 

and your mom would drink until she was no longer speaking
and dad would dream of all the different ways to die
each one a little more than he could dare to try

F C Bb  (x4)

but if you think i'll take a bullet for you - you're dreaming.

C9 better as C, D/F# is D

G *C9 D7 D/F#    They're tearing up streets again    They're building a new hotel
G *C9 D7 D/F#    The mayor's out killing kids        To keep taxes down
G *C9 D7 D/F#    And me and my anger sit             Folding a paper bird
G *C9 D7 D/F#    Letting the curtains turn           To beating wings

C *C G-D/F# Em   Wish I had a socket set             To dismantle this morning
C *C D7 D/F#     Just one pair of clean socks        And a photo of you

G *C9 D7 D/F#    When you get off work tonight       Meet me at the cnstrctn site
G *C9 D7 D/F#    And we'll write some notes to tape  To the heavy machines
G *C9 D7 D/F#    Like we hope they treat you well    Hope you don't work too hard
G *C9 D7 D/F#    We hope you get to be               Happy sometimes

C *C G-D/F# Em   Bring your Swiss Army Knife         And a bottle of something
C *C D7 D/F#     And I'll bring some spray paint     And a new deck of cards

G *C9 D7 D/F#    Hey I found the safest place        To keep all our tenderness
G *C9 D7 D/F#    Keep all those bad ideas            Keep all our hope
G *C9 D7 D/F#    It's here in the smallest bones     The feet and the inner ear
G *C9 D7 D/F#    It's such and enormous thing        To walk to listen

C *C G-D/F# Em   And I'd like to fall asleep         To the beat of you breathing
C *C D7 D/F#     In a room near a truck stop         On a highway somewhere

G *C9 D7 D/F#    Well you are a radio                You are an open door
G *C9 D7 D/F#    I am a faulty string                Of blue Christmas lights
G *C9 D7 D/F#    You swim through frequencies        You let that stranger in
G *C9 D7 D/F#    As I'm blinking off and on          And off again

C *C G-D/F# Em   And we've got a lot of time         Or maybe we don't
C *C D7 D/F      But I'd like to think so            So let me pretend

G *C9 D7 D/F#    Well these are my favorite chords   I know you like them too
G *C9 D7 D/F#    When I get a new guitar             You could have this one
G *C9 D7 D/F#    And sing me a lullabye              Sing me the alphabet
G *C9 D7 D/F#    Sing me a story I                   Haven't heard yet

Song: Two-Headed Boy
Album: In the Aeroplane Over the Sea
Artist: Neutral Milk Hotel

G

G B G B   Two headed boy /  All floating in glass
G B C G   The sun it has passed / Now it's blacker than black
C C D D   I can hear as you tap on your jar
C C G G   I am listening to hear where you are
C C G G   I am listening to hear where you are

G B G B   Two headed boy / Put on sunday shoes
G B C G   And dance round the room to accordion keys
C C D D   With the needle that sings in your heart
C C G G   Catching signals that sound in the dark
C C G     Catching signals that sound in the dark
        D            C           
We will take off our clothes
                       G                   D               C
And they'll be placing fingers through the notches in your spine
                           G                  D             C
And when all is breaking , everything that you could keep inside
                            Am                                  D
now you're eyes aint moving now, they just lay there in their cloud

G B G B   Two headed boy / With pulleys and weights
G B C G   Creating a radio played just for two
C C D D   In the parlor with a moon across her face
C C G G   And through the music he sweetly displays
C C G     Silver speakers that sparkle all day
             C                        Am                                D    C
Made for his lover who's floating and choking with her hands across her face
           G            D             C
And in the dark we will take off our clothes
                        G                  D               C
And they'll be placing fingers through the notches in your spine
                          G               D               C
And when all is breaking, everything that you could keep inside
                            Am                                  D
now you're eyes ain't moving now, they just lay there in their clouououououd


G B G B   Two headed boy / There's no reason to grieve 
G B C G   The world that you need is wrapped in gold silver sleeves
C C D D   Left beneath Christmas trees in the snow
C C G G   And I will take you and leave you alone
C C G     Watching spirals of white softly flow
          C
Over your eyelids and all you did
                                       D
Will wait until the point when you let go
C                G
Dee dee dee dee de

G Bm C G       Puff, the magic dragon, lived by the sea, 
C G Em-A7 D    and frolicked in the autumn mist in a land calley Honey Lee. 
G Bm C G       Little Jackie Paper loved that rascal Puff, 
C G-Em A7-D G  and brought him string and sealing wax and other fancy stuff. 

(Chorus) 

G Bm C G       Puff, the magic dragon, lived by the sea, 
C G Em-A7 D    and frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honey Lee. 
G Bm C G       Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea 
C G-Em A7-D G  and frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honey Lee. 

G Bm C G       Together they would travel on a boat with billowed sail, 
C G Em-A7 D    Jackie kept a lookout perched on Puff's gigantic tail. 
G Bm C G       Noble kings and princes would bow whenever they came, 
C G-Em A7-D G  pirate ships would lower their flags when Puff roared out his name

(Chorus) 

G Bm C G        A dragon lives forever, but not so little boys, 
C G Em A7 D     painted wings and giant rings make way for other toys. 
G Bm C G        One grey night it happened, Jackie Paper came no more, 
C G Em A7 D G   and Puff, that mighty dragon, he ceased his fearless roar. 

(Chorus) 

G Bm C G        His head was bent in sorrow, green scales feel like rain, 
C G Em A7 D     Puff no longer went to play along the Cherry Lane. 
G Bm C G        Without his life-long friend, Puff could not be brave, 
C G Em A7 D G   so Puff, that mighty dragan, sadly slipped into his cave. 

(Chorus)

Whole Wide World

Lyrics
When I was a young boy
My mama said to me
There's only one girl in the world for you
But she probably lives in Tahiti

I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
Just to find her

Or maybe she's in the Bahamas
Where the Carribean sea is blue
Weeping in a tropical moonlit night
Because nobody's told her 'bout you

I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
Just to find her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
Find out where they hide her

Why am I hanging around in the rain out here
Trying to pick up a girl
Why are my eyes filling up with these lonely tears
When there're girls all over the world

Is she lying on a tropical beach somewhere
Underneath the tropical sun
Pining away in a heatwave there
Hoping that I won't be long

I should be lying on that sun-soaked beach with her
Caressing her warm brown skin
And then in a year or maybe not quite
We'll be sharing the same next of kin

I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
Just to find her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
Find out where they hide her

G D      I'm HEADED down South to the LAND of the pines
Em	C     I'm THUMBIN' my way to NORTH Caroline
G D C C  StaRING up the road and PRAY to God I see HEADLIGHTS  	

G D      I MADE it down the coast in seventeen hours	
Em	C     PICKIN' me a bouquet of DOGWOOD flowers
G D C C  And I'm HOPING for Raleigh; *I* can see my baby TONIGHT  	

(Chorus)

So, ROCK me mama like a WAGON wheel / ROCK me mama any WAY you feel
HEEEEEEEEE EEEEY mama ROCK me    	
ROCK me mama like the wind and THE rain / ROCK me mama like a SOUTH bound train
HEEEEEEEEE EEEEY mama ROCK me    	
 	 	 	
Runnin' from the cold, up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old town string band
My baby plays the guitar; I pick a banjo now

Ahh, the North Country winters keep a gettin' me down
Lost my money playin' poker so I had'a'up and leave town
But I ain't a turning back, to livin' that old life no more

(Chorus)
 	 	 	
Walkin' to the South out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Phillie; had a nice long toke
But he's a headed west from the Cumberland Gap
Johnson City, Tennessee

Now I gotta get a move on, before the sun
I hear my baby callin' my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh, least I will die free

(Chorus)

It's got bums when it's cold like any other place
                A7
It's warm up inside
  Em                            A7

Hallelujah

[Introduction]  C// Am// C// Am//

     C                 Am
I've heard there was a secret chord
     C                   Am
That David played and it pleased the Lord
    F                G              C      G7
But you don't really care for music do you

   C                   F           G
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
    Am              F
The minor fall, the major lift
    G               Em           Am
The baffled King composing Hallelujah

     F           Am
Hallelujah, hallelujah
     F           C G C    G7
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah

Maybe I've been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah

There was a time when you let me know
What's real and going on below?
But now you never show it to me, do you
Remember when I moved in you
The Holy Dark was moving too
And every breath we drew was hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah


Maybe there's a God above
And all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you?
And it's not a cry you can hear at night
It's not someone who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah


This follows the Rufus Wainwright piano version of the tune and
can be capo'd to suit individual's voice range

Intro: F# C# F# C# F# C# G#

C# G# F# C#
F# C# G# G#

In the boardroom the quiet man takes a second to think what to do;
He's out of his seat and he's starting to speak and he hears his own voice;
For years and years he's done nothing but bear down, /
	 and put up with all their demands;
She sits like a viper and offers a clock without giving a damn...He takes it;
"Honour forbids me, but honour be damned, /
	you have wined till you got what you want;
I did the work and when things were going badly you left us to rot";

Bridge: F# C# F# C# F# C# G# G#

He locks the door of the boardroom and turns, /
	like the scene from the old country song;
Towering over the table he is lost; he is drunk with it all:
"You only came back to us when we'd turned it around, /
	when we'd rescued your arse from the fire;
Your contribution to all that we did is to say it was dire"

Bridge

(one strum)
"Night after day after night I've been working, despite of you fucking us all;
Now I'm going to die, I don't care if you cry, just please leave me alone;
(normal)
And spare those tears for yourself, we've had those 'till we're sick, /
	 you should leave while you still the chance";
(F# C# F# C#)  The others were shocked at this shameful display /
	at the end of an hounoured career;
He paused in the silence to pull down his tie and observe the melee.


Given that these are all sharp chords, they can be played barre style, or open on capo one; whichever 
better to your ear.

Another turning point a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist directs you where to go
So make the best of this test and don't ask why
It's not a question but a lesson learned in time
It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

So take the photographs and still frames in your mind.
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time.
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial.
Through what its worth it was worth all the while
It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

I drink to remember, I smoke to forget
Some things to be proud of, some stuff to regret
Been down some dark alleys, in my own head
Something is changing, changing, changing.

I go back to Clifton to see my old friends
The best people I could ever have met
Skin up a fat one, hide from the Feds
Something is changing, changing, changing.

So I kiss goodbye to every little ounce of pain
Light a cigarette and wish the world away
I got out I got out out alive and I'm here to stay

So I hold two fingers up to yesterday
Light a cigarette and smoke it all away
I got out, I got out, out alive and I'm here to stay

Down in the kitchen drinking white lightning
He's with my momma, yelling and fighting
It's not the first time praying for silence
Something is changing, changing, changing

If I get murdered in the city / Don't go revenging in my name
One person dead from such is plenty / No need to go get locked away
When I leave your arms / The things I think of
No need to get over alarmed, / I'm coming home

I wonder which brother is better / Which one our parents loved the most
I sure did get in lots of trouble / They seemed to let the other go

A tear fell from my father's eyes
I wondered what my dad would say
He said I love you
And I'm proud of you both, in so many different-

If I get murdered in the city / Go read the letter in my desk
Don't bother with all my belongings / Pay attention to the list

Make sure my sister knows I loved her
Make sure my mother knows the same
Always remember, there is nothing worth sharing
Like the love that let us share our name
Always remember, there is nothing worth sharing
Like the love that let us share our name

Finish with a strong C

(CC)Love writes a letter and (G)sends it to (C)hate.
My (FFF)vacations ending. I'm coming home (C)late.
The (F)weather was (G)fine and the (C)ocean was (Am)great
and I (C)can't wait to (G)see you (FF)again.

Hate reads the letter and throws it away.
"No one here cares if you go or you stay.
I barely even noticed that you were away.
I'll see you or I won't, whatever."

Love sings a song as she sails through the sky.
The water looks bluer through her pretty eyes.
And everyone knows it whenever she flies,
and also when she comes down.

Hate keeps his head up and walks through the street.
Every stranger and drifter he greets.
And shakes hands with every loner he meets
with a serious look on his face.

Love arrives safely with suitcase in tow.
Carrying with her the good things we know.
A reason to live and a reason to grow.
To trust. To hope. To care.

Hate sits alone on the hood of his car.
Without much regard to the moon or the stars.
Lazily killing the last of a jar
of the strongest stuff you can drink.

Love takes a taxi, a young man drives.
As soon as he sees her, hope fills his eyes.
But tears follow after, at the end of the ride,
cause he might never see her again.

Hate gets home lucky to still be alive.
He screams o'er the sidewalk and into the drive.
The clock in the kitchen says 2:55,
And the clock in the kitchen is slow.

Love has been waiting, patient and kind.
Just wanting a phone call or some kind of sign,
That the one that she cares for, who's out of his mind,
Will make it back safe to her arms.

Hate stumbles forward and leans in the door.
Weary head hung, eyes to the floor.
He says "Love, I'm sorry", and she says, "What for?
I'm your and that's it, Whatever.
I should not have been gone for so long.
I'm yours and that's it, forever."

You're mine and that's it, forever.



  F               G    C        B/C  Am
I should not have been gone for so   long.
    C                 G   F

You're mine and that's it, forever.

Sorry, no tabs on this one. Figured it out by ear. Though it's
fairly simple. Essentially: verse chords = G (add C on 2nd
string, then back to open B), e minor (add C on 2nd string, then
back to open B), then D (with that little riff), C, and
G. Chorus chords = G, D (with riff), C. If you want to play
along with the CD, then it's capo on the 1st fret (key of
Ab). For this vid, I tuned down a whole step (DGCFAD = key of F
for this song). Cheers

And I drop my paintbrush in the dirt

Still reminds me just how much it hurt
          Am                    G
I cut my hand, wait for it to work
C                     F        G       
But I just couldn't bring him back

No, I just couldn't bring him back

I just can't seem to get it right today

Oh, I just can't seem to get it right today

Freight train, freight train, run so fast
Freight train, freight train, run so fast
Please don't tell what train I'm on
They won't know what route I'm going

When I'm dead and in my grave
No more good times here I crave
Place the stones at my head and feet
And tell them all I've gone to sleep

When I die, oh bury me deep
Down at the end of old Chestnut Street
So I can hear old Number Nine
As she comes rolling by

When I die, oh bury me deep
Down at the end of old Chestnut Street
Place the stones at my head and feet
And tell them all I've gone to sleep

Freight train, freight train, run so fast
Freight train, freight train, run so fast
Please don't tell what train I'm on
They won't know what route I'm going

Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe

Iff'n you don't know by now
       C               G              Am         /g
An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
D7/f#              G  (G6-G7)
It'll never do somehow

          C                    C7
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
F                        D7/f#
Look out your window and I'll be gone
       C   G          Am   /g   F
You're the reason I'm trav'lin' on
    C           G            C
But don't think twice, it's alright

       C               G               Am         /g
An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe

The light I never knowed
       C               G               Am         /g
An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe

I'm on the dark side of the road

Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
F                            D7/f#
To try and make me change my mind and stay
   C     G            Am   /g    F
We never did too much talkin' anyway
    C           G            C
But don't think twice, it's alright

      C               G              Am         /g
So it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal

Like you never done before
       C               G               Am         /g

I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' walkin' down the road
F                       D7/f#
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
  C           G             Am   /g       F
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
    C           G            C
But don't think twice, it's alright

C  G           Am    /g
So long, honey babe
F                        C       G
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
C          G          Am       /g
Goodbye is too good a word, babe
   D7/f#                   G  (G6-G7)
So I'll just say fare thee well
  C                        C7
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
F                              D7/f#
You could have done better but I don't mind
C                     G  Am       /g   F
You just kinda wasted my precious time
    C           G            C
But don't think twice, it's alright

Enjoy!

NOTES & TABS

Guitar Chords Used

Here is how you play the guitar chords used in this song. Pretty damn straightforward. You can throw in an Am7 if you like, in place of the Am chord (leave the G string open, and/or add your pinky to the 3rd fret of the high E chord). Otherwise, there is room for feeling in this one -- don't feel too boxed in and just roll with it.

My house in Budapest / My, my hidden treasure chest
Golden grand piano / My beautiful Castillo

You / Ooh, you / Ooh, I'd leave it all

My acres of a land / That I've achieved
It may be hard for you to / Stop and believe

But for you / Ooh, you / Ooh, I'd leave it all
Ooh, for you / Ooh, you / Ooh, I'd leave it all

And give me one good reason / Why I should never make a change
Baby if you hold me / Then all of this will go away

My many artifacts / The list goes on
If you just say the words / I, I'll up and run

Oh, to you / Ooh, you / Ooh, I'd leave it all
Oh, to you / Ooh, oh / Ooh, I'd leave it all

And give me one good reason / Why I should never make a change
Baby if you hold me / Then all of this will go away

Give me one good reason / Why I should never make a change
Baby if you hold me / Then all of this will go away

My friends and family / They don't understand
They fear they'd lose so much / If you take my hand

But, for you / Ooh, you / Ooh, I'd lose it all
Oh, for you / Ooh, you / Ooh, I'd lose it all

And give me one good reason / Why I should never make a change
Baby if you hold me / Then all of this will go away

Kick off your high-heeled sneakers / It's party time

As long as it plays 'till dawn
No static at all

Feed her some hungry reggae / She'll love you twice

I came to see you up there in intensive care
They had handcuffed you to your bed
There were tubes going into you and out from you
Bright white gauze bandages at your head

I am a mole
Sticking his head above the surface of the earth
I am a mole
Sticking his head above the surface of the earth

And they said "Lights out"
And it was lights out
And they gave you your medication
I know what you want and you know what I want

I am a mole
Sticking his head above the surface of the earth
I am a mole
Sticking his head above the surface of the earth

Out in the desert we'll have no worries
Out in the desert just you and me
I came to see you up there in intensive care
Out in the desert we'll live carefree

Sticking his head above the surface of the earth
I am a mole
Sticking his head above the surface of the earth

======================================================================
A quick note on chords.  The actual name of the Fmaj7* is Fmaj7b5, which looks like this:

e| 0
B| 1
G| 2
D| 3
A| 0
E| x

As played here, you could call them C-Cmaj7-C (without a 3rd/5th for the C and no 3rd 
for the Cmaj7) and F5-Fdim-F5 (no b3rd for the Fdim).

As they're plucked here, it's easier to just make the C/Fmaj7 shape respectively and 
lift up your index finger for the major 7th.  That also allows you to do John Darnielle's 
cool little extra bits.  You can also choose to pluck the G string with a third finger.

Here's the progression.  These progression is fingerpicked.
e|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
B|---1--0--1----1--0--1----1--0--1----1--0--1-------------------------------|
G|--(0)(0)(0)--(2)(2)(2)--(0)(0)(0)--(0)(0)(0)------------------------------|
D|--------------3--3--3-----------------------------------------------------|
A|---3--3--3---------------3--3--3----3--3--3-------------------------------|
E|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Simple enough, right?  Sir Darnielle throws in little flourishes that shouldn't be too 
hard to do.  Just keep making that C-esque shape and pluck around some of the other 
strings too.  If you can figure out a single note run that sounds good, do it.

Taboo VI: The Homecoming - Going To Alaska
G                C
The jacaranda are wet with color,
        G                            D
and the heat is a great paint brush, lending color to our lives,
     G                                C
to the air, and to out faces; but I'm going to Alaska
              G                         D
where there's snow to suck the sound out from the air.

C G

G       C
Up, yes, in the branches,
G                       D
the purple blossoms, go pale at the edges;
         G                              C
there is moaning in the shifting of the sap, and I see in them traces
G                           D
of last year, but then they hadn't grown so strong,
G                                    C
and their limbs were more like wires. Now they are cables.
G                           D                    G
thick and alive with alien electricity, and I am going to Alaska,
     C                         G
where you can go blind just by looking at the ground,
D
where fat is eaten by itself
C                         G
just to keep your body warm.

G                         C
Because from where we are now, it seems, really,
    G                           D
that everything is growing in a thousand different ways;
G                                        C
that the soil is soaked through with old blood and with relatives
G                                           D
who were buried here, or close to here, and they are giving rise
G                                C
to what is happening. Or can you tell me otherwise?
     G                          D
I am going to Alaska, where the animals can kill you,
        G                     C
but they do so in silence, as though if no-one hears them,
        G                         D
then it really won't matter. I am going to Alaska.
C                                     G
They tell me that it's perfect for my purposes.

a knocking sound it woke me up,
but my legs were feeling weak.
i stared up at the ceiling and i saw you at the window.
but my mouth wouldn't let me speak.

DD    i know you.
ADGD  you're the one i spent three seasons trying to pretend
AD    that i never knew.

something pulled me off the bed.
and the same thing moved the muscles in my legs.
i moved towards your voice, and my body got so light,
i could've walked on eggs right then and not broken a one of them.

//of course, after the first chorus, resort to strumming!//

There are a few variations in the song, for instance the intro,
when he switches from D to Dsus he hits the root note twice and
skips the G string, or at the part where he says "window" in the
first verse, he strums the Dsus a few times.  Play the chorus
the 3 last times just strumming the chorus chords, simple
enough.

you stood like galatea, over me

Alpha Omega

Tabbed by Alex Glasnovic (Gray.Fox@Gmail.com)

This can either be plucked or strummed, plucked uses the A and B strings simultaneously. 
Regardless of which, hammer on and off the B string where appropriate. 
Listen to it live or the studio recording to get a good idea of when this is done.

March through the red mist, never get my vision clear
Learn to love this kind of atmosphere
Strike funny poses, keep my weapon hand low
Whip my head around a little, get blood on the front row

Gonna jab you in the eye with a foreign object
I personally will stab you in the eye with a foreign object
Foreign object, foreign object, foreign object

Sink my teeth into your scalp, take a nice big bite
Save nothing for the cameras, play the angles all night
One of these days my legs will both snap like twigs
If you can't beat 'em make 'em bleed like pigs

I'm gonna jab you in the eye with a foreign object
I'm gonna stab you in the eye with a foreign object

The previous tab of this song said you could play with a capo on the first fret.
That would be the easiest way to play along, but this pitch only matches 
that of the vinyl rip circulating online.
I've been told that the record is actually a half step lower in pitch.
This would explain the "younger" sound of John's voice that people have mentioned.
Playing it the way I have here will match the actual record,
as well as live performances of the song.
So, in reality, go ahead capo the first fret, but only if you want to match the incorrect vinyl rip.
I'll admit, I am quite fond of the sound, but nonetheless, it is wrong.


Also, on the G chord between verses and on the C chord
of the outro, John plays a little lick. 
It would look like this:
e---------
B---------
G---------
D---------
A-3-2-0---
E-------3-
Easiest way to do this is to keep your hand in the G position, but move your 
index and middle fingers up to the A and D strings, allowing you to quickly 
jump back down to G. I'll use a * to indicate when to play the lick.
Also, throughout most of the song, when you play a C, hold the G note on the 
high e string. I don't believe he holds it on any other chord except for G.
The C you should play looks like this:
e-3-------
B-1-------
G-0-------
D-2-------
A-3-------
E---------
