D G D G   the cave mouth shines / by pure force of will
D G D G   i look down on the world / from the top of this lonesome hill
D A D G   and you can run, and run some more / from here all the way to singapore
D A D     but i will carry you home in my teeth


D G D G   in the great hall you drink red wine / you chew meat off the bone
D G D G   i beat down the new path to the castle / i come naked and alone
D A D G   i laid my son on the bier, i burned the wreath /
            fire overhead, water underneath
D A D G   you can stand up or you can run / you and i both know what you've done
D A D G   and i will carry you home / i will carry you home
D A D     i will carry you home in my teeth

D Em A G   the trees were all decked out in their best fall colors
              there was a snap in the air

              and the new york sun brought out the highlights in your hair
D A D G    and gently, gently / the constellations aligned
D A G D    and as we crossed over the throgs neck bridge i had

D Em A G   i could feel the new day dawn
              and somebody had gone and turned the waterworks on

Bring me something new that I haven't felt before
The messages of love and directions to you door
But please talk slowly, I don't hear good anymore
And we all Fall down
And we all Fall down  

Don't die on me lady, only good things can come 
To those who practice reason and recognize good fun
Your absence is the bullet and the past is your gun 
And we all fall down
And we all fall down

She still doesn't answer though she knows shes done wrong
We buried the memories along with the songs
When she wakes up, I hope that we are gone
And we all fall down
And we all fall down

There's a visitor in black at my neighbors house
My neighbor says tomorrow the visitor says now 
When he comes here please tell him that I'm out
And we all fall down
And we all fall down

Note:  Standard Tuning.
Use barre chords.  The trick to the sound is to remove your index finger - listen to the rhythm for timing.

Intro:

B D A x2

Verse:

B D   Look beyond the broken bottles
A B   Past the rotting wooden stairs
B D   Root out the wine-dark honeyed center
A E   Not everyone can live like millionaires

B D A B (harmonica)

B D  Look through the air-thin walls
A B  Tear up the floorboards strip the paint
B D  Go over every inch of space
A E  With the patience of a saint

E E B B    Grab your hat get your coat
B D A B    The cellar door is an open throat

B D   Look past the kitchen cabinets
A B   Go through the chest of drawers
B D   Scrutinize the casements
A E   Rip the varnish off the doors

B D   Dig up the laughing photographs
A B   They're here somewhere or other

C#m G# A B   skin the color of a walnut shell,
E G# A B     and a baseball cap holding down her black hair.

C#m G# A B   he drove in from mexicali, no worse for wear.
E G# A B     money to burn, time to kill.
C#m G# A B   but five minutes looking in his eyes
E G# A B     and we all knew he was broken pretty bad, so we gave him what we
A A B B      had.  we cleared a space for him to sleep in, and we let the
E E A A      SIlence that's our trademark MAKE its presence felt.

C#m G# A B   and they came from zimbabwe,  or from soviet georgia.
E G# A B     east saint louis, or from paris, or they lived across the street.
A A B B      but they came, and when they'd FINALLY made it here,
E E A A      it was the least that we could do to make our welcome clear.

E E A A      come on in, we haven't slept for weeks.

Neutral Milk Hotel - The King of Carrot Flowers Pt. 1

F C Bb  (x2)

When you were young you were the king of carrot flowers
and how you built a tower tumbling through the trees
In holy rattlesnakes that fell all 'round your feet

and your mom would stick a fork right into daddy's shoulder
and dad would throw the garbage all across the floor
as we would lay and learn what each other's bodies were for 

F C Bb  (x2)

and this is the room one afternoon I knew I could love you
and from above you how I sank into your soul
into that secret place where no one dares to go 

and your mom would drink until she was no longer speaking
and dad would dream of all the different ways to die
each one a little more than he could dare to try

F C Bb  (x4)

C Fmaj7   December
C Fmaj7   And she told me how you'd died at last, at last
             / And that morning at the racetrack
C Fmaj7   was one thing I remember

Intro:  Riff x2

G       On the day that Dennis Brown's lung
C-D     collapsed / Spring rain was misting down on
RIFF    Kingston

G       And down at the harbor local
C-D     cops were intercepting an inbound
RIFF    shipment

C G     And for a while there it was chaos
C D     As they handcuffed and then ruffed up some sailors.
G       On the day my lung collapses
C-D     it's not gonna be that different.
RIFF    different

G     On the day that Dennis Brown's habits
C-D   caught up with him School children sang in
RIFF  choirs.

G     And out behind the Chinese
C-D   restaurants Guys were jumping into
RIFF  dumpsters

C G     And the stench was overbearing
C D     But they were past the point of caring.
G       On the day my habits catch up
C-D     with me, I'll be down among
RIFF    the jumpers.

G C-D   And jets of contaminated blood Will cloud the rivers and
RIFF    the lakes.

C G      It took all the coke in town
C D      To bring down Dennis Brown.

the jericho palm tree is plush and green

bright sun, the new day
i felt sick in a good way
felt the fever climb when you came down
all the way across town

and you brought me a plate of sweet potatoes

sun fading overhead
the sunset, bright red
your green eyes, your smooth walk
fresh tomato, celery stalk, you cook
pot of pari basmati rice
i felt good, you looked nice
you stood like galatea, over me
fried garlic, kim chee

but don't touch that dial,
'cause there is no reason to cry.

there's a guttural stop in my throat.
there's a guttural stop in my throat.
the wind comes in from far and wide.
sands blow, grains collide.
I'm changing inside.
and there's a guttural stop in my throat.

Verse:
 D  Em        The men were here to get your Belgian things
 Em A         They'll store them for you in an airplane hangar
 D  Em        There's guys in biohazard suits, mud kicking on their rubber boots
 Em Aadd4 A   They've come to keep your pretty things from danger

D  G    D  G

 D  Em        The men were here to get your Belgian things
 Em A         They'll spend the whole day hauling them downstairs
 D  Em        I shot a roll of thirty-two exposures
 Em Aadd4 A   My camera groans beneath the weight it bears

Chorus:
 G A        I can see you in my sleep
 D G        Playing the points for all you're worth
 G Aadd4 A  Walking gingerly across the bruised earth

D  G    D  G    D  G    D  G

 D  Em        The men were here to get your Belgian things
 Em A         They waltzed right through the door and went flourescent
 D  Em        Their boots were black and shiny and your treasures gleamed like stars
 Em Aadd4 A   Bones from deep down in the fertile crescent

D  G    D  G

 D  Em        The arteries are clogging in the mainframe
 Em A         There's too much information in the pipes
 D  Em        I saw the mess you left up in the east bedroom
 Em A         A tiger's never gonna change its stripes

Bridge:
 G A    I guess, I guess
 F#m G  But Jesus what a mess
 Bm D    One way in and
 G A    No way out

D  G    D  G    D  G    D  G

 D  Em        The men were here to get your Belgian things
 Em A         And only I was here to see them do it
 D  Em        I wish you had a number where you are
 Em Aadd4 A   It's hard with no one here to help me through it

 G A        I can see you in my sleep
 D G        Playing the points for all you're worth
 G Aadd4 A  Walking gingerly across the bruised earth

Album Version:

G C G D  G C G D  

G                C
The jacaranda are wet with color,
        G                            D
and the heat is a great paint brush, lending color to our lives,
     G                                C
to the air, and to out faces; but I'm going to Alaska
              G                         D
where there's snow to suck the sound out from the air.

C G

G       C
Up, yes, in the branches,
G                       D
the purple blossoms, go pale at the edges;
         G                              C
there is moaning in the shifting of the sap, and I see in them traces
G                           D
of last year, but then they hadn't grown so strong,
G                                    C
and their limbs were more like wires. Now they are cables.
G                           D                    G
thick and alive with alien electricity, and I am going to Alaska,
     C                         G
where you can go blind just by looking at the ground,
D
where fat is eaten by itself
C                         G
just to keep your body warm.

G                         C
Because from where we are now, it seems, really,
    G                           D
that everything is growing in a thousand different ways;
G                                        C
that the soil is soaked through with old blood and with relatives
G                                           D
who were buried here, or close to here, and they are giving rise
G                                C
to what is happening. Or can you tell me otherwise?
     G                          D
I am going to Alaska, where the animals can kill you,
        G                     C
but they do so in silence, as though if no-one hears them,
        G                         D
then it really won't matter. I am going to Alaska.
C                                     G
They tell me that it's perfect for my purposes.

Going to Maine

put a capo on the first fret. then it's just G, C(Add9), and D.

G:       320000

C(Add9): 032030

D:       000232

You and me are in a lot of trouble
And somebody's gonna burst our bubble
Your husband
My wife
My marriage
Your life

Let's go to Maine out on the East Coast
Let's go to Maine right now
Let's beat the retreat
Let's hop on the plane
Let's get out of here
Let's go to Maine

Someone knows what's going on
Someone knows, and someone's gonna tell
Someone's gonna wrap us up in styrofoam and paper
And mail us flat-rate right down to Hell

Stars Fell on Alabama

G                D          Cadd9              G
you looked real calm as we made our way up the walk

G                D      Cadd9               G
there were lazy kisses, hands brushing and small talk	

G             D    G                  C            G      D    G
the moon was high, your smooth face was dry, and the kudzu grew
 
G             D           Cadd9    G
and the stars fell on alabama

G            D                G
and your eyes filled up with light

G            D            G  C  G    D    G
and the stars fell on alabama

the warm earth underneath us gave way
<dry grass crinkled like paper as a breeze came in across the bay
cold clean water nearby, glimmered in your eyes 
and your pistol glistened.

and the stars fell on alabama
and your eyes filled up with light
and the stars fell on alabama

but if you think i'll take a bullet for you - you're dreaming.

Song: Autoclave
Artist: The Mountain Goats

C Cmaj7 Am G X2

C            Cmaj7        Am           G
Hand me your hand let me look in your eyes 
C                         Cmaj7  Am           G
as my last chance to feel human begins to vaporize 
C              Cmaj7        Am             G
maybe it's the heat in here maybe it's the pressure 
F
you ought to head for the exits the sooner the better

          C      Cmaj7    Am                G
I am this great, unstable mass of blood and foam 
C             Cmaj7      Am                 G
And no in her right mind would make my home her home
F
My heart is an autoclave
F
My heart is an autoclave

C                  Cmaj7     Am               G
When I try to open up to you I get completely lost
C                Cmaj7        Am                 G
Houses swallowed by the earth windows thick with frost
C                     Cmaj7      Am                     G
And I reach deep down within but the pathways twist and turn
F
And there's no light anywhere and nothing left to burn

                          C     Cmaj7    Am                G
And I am this great unstable mass of blood and foam
C              Cmaj7               Am                    G
And no emotion that's worth having can call my heart its home
F
My hearts an autoclave
F
My hearts an autoclave

C                    Cmaj7          Am              G
I dream't that I was perched atop a throne of human skulls
C                    Cmaj7         Am                 G
On a cliff above the ocean howling wind and shrieking seagulls
C                     Cmaj7       Am           G
And the dream went on forever one single static frame
F
Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name

          C      Cmaj7    Am                G
I am this great, unstable mass of blood and foam 
C             Cmaj7      Am                 G
And no in her right mind would make her home my home

Intro:  the same chords as the first verse

    A         E    A
I'm writing a song all about you

  D                    A
A true song as real as my tears

           D                         A         D
But you've no need to fear it 'cause no one will hear it

A                            E           A
Sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year

(2nd verse: same as first)


Bridge: 
       E                         A
It's a good thing that I'm not a star

You don't know how lucky you aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-re


Last verse:

BRIDGE

( G )| G/F# | Em | Em7 | C   | D - Dsus - D | 

VERSE (1)

The light reflecting off the mirror ball 
looks like a thousand swirling eyes 
They make me think I shouldn't be here at all 
You know, every minute someone dies 


VERSE(2)

What are we doing in this dive bar 
How can you live in a place like this 
Why don't you just get into my car 
and I'll take you away I'll take that kiss now, but 


CHORUS


BRIDGE (X2)


VERSE (2)

And now it's 55 years later 
We've had the romance of the century 
After all these years wrestling gators 
I still feel like crying when I think of what you said to me 


CHORUS

 C    D         G  G/F#
Papa was a rodeo 


OUTRO

Em7       D               C         D     G
What a coincidence, your Papa was a rodeo too.

Tuning - Standard: EADGBE

Tabbed By: Jeremy Waterman
Contact: jeremysexytime@gmail.com

It may look like some of the chords are placed really strangely, however,
I'm fairly certain everything is in the correct place. I listened through
the whole song to place the chord changes in, but there's still probably
a few small mistakes. As for the chords themselves, they're only basic
chords, but they sound just fine.
The other tab for this, which is what I based mine from, uses C7 instead
of C. If you think that sounds better with this, use that.
C7, in case you wanted to use it, is:
e[--0--]
B[--1--]
G[--3--]
D[--2--]

FFCC   sometimes it seems so useless to remain
FFCC   You don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
CGCC   You never even call me by my name.

CGCC   You don't have to call me Waylon Jennings
CGCC   And you don't have to call me Charlie Pride.
FFCAm  You don't have to call me Merle Haggard, anymore.
DDGG   Even though your on my fightin' side.

FFCC   And I'll hang around as long as you will let me
CGCC   And I never minded standin' in the rain.
FFCC   You don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
CGCG   You never even call me by my name.

CGCC   I've heard my name a few times in your phone book
FFCC   I've seen it on signs where I've laid
FFCAm  But the only time I know, I'll hear David Allan Coe
DDGG   Is when Jesus has his final judgement day.

CGCC   Well, I was drunk the day my Mom got outta prison.
FFCC   And I went to pick her up in the rain.
FFCAm  But, before I could get to the station in my pickup truck
DDGG   IShe got runned over by a damned old train.

FFCC   So I'll hang around as long as you will let me

Give up on trying to save us

To piss off the dumb few that forgave us

I hope the fences we mended

Someday burns down

     Db
And I hope you die 
   Ab                    Db    (back to intro part)
I hope we both die 


I hope I cut myself shaving tomorrow 
I hope it bleeds all day long 
Our friends say it's darkest before the sun rises 
We're pretty sure they're all wrong 
I hope it stays dark forever 
I hope the worst isn't over 
And I hope you blink before I do 


Yeah I hope I never get sober 

And I hope when you think of me years down the line 
You can't find one good thing to say 
And I'd hope that if I found the strength to walk out 
You'd stay the hell out of my way 
I am drowning There is no sign of land
You are coming down with me Hand in unlovable hand 
And I hope you die 
I hope we both die

Pink and Blue

Intro:  E D A B   X2

E D A B      Wind out of Oklahoma this morning
E D A B      Smelled like blood an smoke
E D A B      And the crows discuss their future in the
F# F# A B    branches of their Louisiana Live Oak
E D A B      The limbs are strong and heavy and its
E D A B      Leaves are all aglow
E D A B      And the branches brush the upper air
F# F# A B    But the roots reach down to were the bad people go
A A B B      And what will I do with you,
E E C#m C#m  pink and blue?  True
A A B B      gold.  Nine days old.

E D A B  X3

E D A B      Nice new clothes on you
E D A B      And an old cardboard produce box for a cradle
E D A B      I mashed some bananas in a coffee cup
F# F# A B    And I fed you there at the kitchen table
E D A B      Crows outside complaining about the
E D A B      Finer points of local politics
E D A B      Strange wind all full of new smells
F# F# A B    Rust and fur and reception sticks
A A B B      And what will I do with you,

Plea From a Cat Named Virtue
Capo 4
Intro:  E A B A E 

E E A A   Why don't you ever wanna play?       I'm tired of this piece of string
B B A E   You sleep as much as I do now,       and you don't eat much of anything
E E A A   I don't know who you're talking to   I made a search through every room
B B A E   but all I found was dust that moved  with shadows of the afternoon

E E    And listen,
A A    about those bitter songs you sing
Fm Fm  they're not helping anything
A A    they won't make you
E E    strong

E E A A    So we should open up the house      invite the tabby two doors down
B B A E    You could ask your sister if        she doesn't bring her basset hound
E E A A    Ask the things you shouldn't miss   tape hiss and the modern man
B B A E    cold war and card catalogues        to come join us if they can
E E A A    For girly drinks and parlor games   we'll pass around the easy lie
B B A E    of absolutely no regrets            and later maybe you could try
E E A A    To let your losses dangle off       the sharp edge of a century
B B A E    We'll talk about the weather or     how the weather use to be

E E    And I'll cater,
A A    with all the birds that I can kill
Fm Fm  let their tiny feathers fill
A A    disappointment
E E    Lie down,
A A    and lick the sorrow from your skin
Fm Fm  Scratch the terror and begin
A A     to believe you're
E E     strong

(SLOWLY)
E E A A    All you ever want to do               is drink and watch TV
E E A A    frankly that thing doesn't really     interest me
E E A A    I swear I'm going to bite you hard    and taste your tinny blood
E E A A    if you don't stop the self-defeating  lies you've been repeating
A A PAUSE  since the day you brought me home     I know you're
E          strong.

A B A E   X 2  End on E

Puncture the roof and set me free

And even if I have to go to Claremont
Well I guess I'll just have to go to Claremont
Let me go
Let me lie low


Yeah but you're going to do what you wanna do
No matter what I ask of you
And you send your dark messengers to tempt me
I come from Chino so all your threats are empty

Song: "Friend is a Four-Letter Word" by Cake
Album: Fashion Nugget

	Its me again.  this song I'm a little less sure about than 'the distance' because I went to the bathroom during this song.  Here goes:

Main Acoustic Riff:

e:I-----------0---------------0---------------1---------
B:I---------1---1-----------1---1-----------1---1-------
G:I-------2-------2-------0-------0-------2-------2-----
D:I-----2-----------2---2-----------2---3-----------3---
A:I---0---------------3---------------------------------
E:I-----------------------------------1-----------------

e:----------2--------I      Repeat this many times, 		
B:--------3---3------I	   listening to the song for
G:------2-------2----I      variations.(At some points,
D:----0-----------0--I      he stays on the A-minor a
A:-------------------I	   few extra times)
E:--2----------------I


Distorted Riff(heard after first verse)

e:I-----------------------------------------I
B:I-----------------------------------------I
G:I-------7-7-6-5-5-------------------------I
D:I--7-7--7-7-6-5-5--5-5-4-3-3--7-7-6-4-4---I
A:I--7-7--5-5-4-3-3--5-5-4-3-3--7-7-6-4-4---I
E:I--5-5-------------3-3-2-1-1--5-5-4-2-2---I

	That's basically the whole song, except for variations of these parts.  Simple, yet cool at the same time.

C9 better as C, D/F# is D

G *C9 D7 D/F#    They're tearing up streets again    They're building a new hotel
G *C9 D7 D/F#    The mayor's out killing kids        To keep taxes down
G *C9 D7 D/F#    And me and my anger sit             Folding a paper bird
G *C9 D7 D/F#    Letting the curtains turn           To beating wings

C *C G-D/F# Em   Wish I had a socket set             To dismantle this morning
C *C D7 D/F#     Just one pair of clean socks        And a photo of you

G *C9 D7 D/F#    When you get off work tonight       Meet me at the cnstrctn site
G *C9 D7 D/F#    And we'll write some notes to tape  To the heavy machines
G *C9 D7 D/F#    Like we hope they treat you well    Hope you don't work too hard
G *C9 D7 D/F#    We hope you get to be               Happy sometimes

C *C G-D/F# Em   Bring your Swiss Army Knife         And a bottle of something
C *C D7 D/F#     And I'll bring some spray paint     And a new deck of cards

G *C9 D7 D/F#    Hey I found the safest place        To keep all our tenderness
G *C9 D7 D/F#    Keep all those bad ideas            Keep all our hope
G *C9 D7 D/F#    It's here in the smallest bones     The feet and the inner ear
G *C9 D7 D/F#    It's such and enormous thing        To walk to listen

C *C G-D/F# Em   And I'd like to fall asleep         To the beat of you breathing
C *C D7 D/F#     In a room near a truck stop         On a highway somewhere

G *C9 D7 D/F#    Well you are a radio                You are an open door
G *C9 D7 D/F#    I am a faulty string                Of blue Christmas lights
G *C9 D7 D/F#    You swim through frequencies        You let that stranger in
G *C9 D7 D/F#    As I'm blinking off and on          And off again

C *C G-D/F# Em   And we've got a lot of time         Or maybe we don't
C *C D7 D/F      But I'd like to think so            So let me pretend

G *C9 D7 D/F#    Well these are my favorite chords   I know you like them too
G *C9 D7 D/F#    When I get a new guitar             You could have this one
G *C9 D7 D/F#    And sing me a lullabye              Sing me the alphabet
G *C9 D7 D/F#    Sing me a story I                   Haven't heard yet

G B G B   Two headed boy /  All floating in glass
G B C G   The sun it has passed / Now it's blacker than black
C C D D   I can hear as you tap on your jar
C C G G   I am listening to hear where you are
C C G G   I am listening to hear where you are

G B G B   Two headed boy / Put on sunday shoes
G B C G   And dance round the room to accordion keys
C C D D   With the needle that sings in your heart
C C G G   Catching signals that sound in the dark
C C G     Catching signals that sound in the dark
        D            C           
We will take off our clothes
                       G                   D               C
And they'll be placing fingers through the notches in your spine
                           G                  D             C
And when all is breaking , everything that you could keep inside

now you're eyes aint moving now, they just lay there in their cloud

G B G B   Two headed boy / With pulleys and weights
G B C G   Creating a radio played just for two
C C D D   In the parlor with a moon across her face
C C G G   And through the music he sweetly displays
C C G     Silver speakers that sparkle all day
             C                        Am                                D    C
Made for his lover who's floating and choking with her hands across her face

And in the dark we will take off our clothes

now you're eyes ain't moving now, they just lay there in their clouououououd


G B G B   Two headed boy / There's no reason to grieve 
G B C G   The world that you need is wrapped in gold silver sleeves
C C D D   Left beneath Christmas trees in the snow
C C G G   And I will take you and leave you alone
C C G     Watching spirals of white softly flow
          C
Over your eyelids and all you did
                                       D
Will wait until the point when you let go

numbers (the C line), subtract 2 from the low G line, and move the 7-6-'s up a string.  
446XXX is an Emaj, so play 0221XX instead.

My love is like a powder keg
       B                      E
In the corner of an empty warehouse
          A               E
Somewhere just outside of town
                B
About to burn down

My love is like a Cuban plane
My love is like a Cuban plane flying from Havana
Up the Florida coast to the 'Glades
Soviet made

Our love is like the border between Greece and Albania
Our love is like the border between Greece and Albania
Trucks loaded down with weapons
Crossing over every night
Moon yellow and bright

           A                     E
There is a shortage in the blood supply
            A                 E
But there is no shortage of blood
A                        E
The way I feel about you baby can't explain it
B                        E
You got the best of my love

Then the end strumming is just an E chord with the suspended fourth

G Bm C G       Puff, the magic dragon, lived by the sea, 
C G Em-A7 D    and frolicked in the autumn mist in a land calley Honey Lee. 
G Bm C G       Little Jackie Paper loved that rascal Puff, 
C G-Em A7-D G  and brought him string and sealing wax and other fancy stuff. 

(Chorus) 

G Bm C G       Puff, the magic dragon, lived by the sea, 
C G Em-A7 D    and frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honey Lee. 
G Bm C G       Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea 
C G-Em A7-D G  and frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honey Lee. 

G Bm C G       Together they would travel on a boat with billowed sail, 
C G Em-A7 D    Jackie kept a lookout perched on Puff's gigantic tail. 
G Bm C G       Noble kings and princes would bow whenever they came, 
C G-Em A7-D G  pirate ships would lower their flags when Puff roared out his name

(Chorus) 

G Bm C G        A dragon lives forever, but not so little boys, 
C G Em A7 D     painted wings and giant rings make way for other toys. 
G Bm C G        One grey night it happened, Jackie Paper came no more, 
C G Em A7 D G   and Puff, that mighty dragon, he ceased his fearless roar. 

(Chorus) 

G Bm C G        His head was bent in sorrow, green scales feel like rain, 
C G Em A7 D     Puff no longer went to play along the Cherry Lane. 
G Bm C G        Without his life-long friend, Puff could not be brave, 
C G Em A7 D G   so Puff, that mighty dragan, sadly slipped into his cave. 

(Chorus)

Em	C     PICKIN' me a bouquet of DOGWOOD flowers
G D C C  And I'm HOPING for Raleigh; *I* can see my baby TONIGHT  	

(Chorus)

G D       So, ROCK me mama like a WAGON wheel
Em	C      ROCK me mama any WAY you feel
G D C C   HEEEEEEEEE EEEEY mama ROCK me    	
G D       ROCK me mama like the wind and THE rain
Em	C      ROCK me mama like a SOUTH bound train
G D C C   HEEEEEEEEE EEEEY mama ROCK me    	
G D Em C
G D C
 	 	 	
Runnin' from the cold, up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old town string band
My baby plays the guitar; I pick a banjo now

Ahh, the North Country winters keep a gettin' me down
Lost my money playin' poker so I had'a'up and leave town
But I ain't a turning back, to livin' that old life no more

(Chorus)

 	G	D	Em	C
 	G	D	C
 	G	D	Em	C
 	G	D	C
 	 	 	
Walkin' to the South out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Phillie; had a nice long toke
But he's a headed west from the Cumberland Gap
Johnson City, Tennessee

Now I gotta get a move on, before the sun
I hear my baby callin' my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh, least I will die free

(Chorus)

A 2-
E 3- instead of the normal G you have there

Dust In The Wind
by: Kansas


This is 100% accurate, i'm completly sure about this!!! There are no mistakes
so try it!

(travis finger picking)
The whole song is played with arpeggio and that's why i thought it is
the first thing to learn from it:
e ---------|
B 0----0---|
G ---0---0-|
D --0---0--|
A 0---0----|
E ---------|
Repeat till you can play it with your eyes closed.

Then the rest is easy.  For the introduction here you have a tip:
trough the introduction the 2nd string (B) makes something like this:
(the arpeggio will aumaticaly do it, you don't have to worry about this)

B 1--0--3
(X6)

But as you play it you wont even notice about it

Then, here are the chords:
          (EADGBe)
C         (x3201x)
Cmaj7     (x3200x)
Cadd3     (x3203x)
Cadd9     (x32030)
Asus2     (x0220x)
Asus4     (x0223x)
Am        (x0221x)
G/B       (x2003x)
G         (3x000x)
Dm7       (xx0211)
D/F#      (2x023x)
Am/G      (3x221x)
Am add9   (x0750x)
G/A       (x0570x)
F(#11)/A  (x0350x)
F6(#11)/A (x0353x)

For G, D/F# and Am/G the arpeggio is played like this:

e -----------|
B 0------0---|
G ---0-----0-|
D --0-----0--|
A -----------|
E 0----0-----|

And for Dm7 it is played like this:

e 0------0---|
B ---0-----0-|
G --0-----0--|
D 0----0-----|
A -----------|
E -----------|

This is the last step:
Right when a paragraph is about to start there is an alteration in the arpeggio:

Example when the first sentence in a paragraph finishes: "#"

  Am             $ C             $ is G/B
e -------------------|
B 1------1--1--1-3-1-|
G ---2-----2--2------|
D --2-----2--2-------|
A 0----0----0--0-2-3-|
E -------------------|

After the introduction it is only: "@"
  Am   $ C (starting the paragraph)
e ---------|
B 1--1-3-1-|
G --2------|
D -2-------|
A 0--0-2-3-|
E ---------|


But after the first Chorus it is played like this: *

  Am                $ C             $ is G/B
e ----------------------|
B 0h1----1----0h1---3-1-|
G -----2----2-----------|
D ----2----2------------|
A -0----0------0----2-3-|
E ----------------------|

And in the instrumental part there is a very little alteration in the arpeggio that
you can practice after you've learned all the song:

  Amadd9  Amadd9  G/A    G/A
e ------------0--------------0---|
B 0---0---0-------0---0--0-------|
G --5---5---5---5---7---7--7---7-|
D -7---7---7---7---5---5--5---5--|
A 0--0----0--0----0--0---0--0----|
E -------------------------------|

*********************************Chords*********************************

For the introduction play:
C Cmaj7 Cadd9 C       Asus2 Asus4 Am Asus2
Cadd9 C Cmaj7 Cadd9   Am Asus2 Asus4 Am (in the last Am play alt "@")

Dm7       (xx0211)
D/F#      (2x023x)
Am/G      (3x221x)

(1st paragraph)
    C   G/B Am     Am
I close my eyes,
G           Dm7            Am               Am
Only for a moment and the moment's gone. (alt "#" instead of both Am)
C   G/B   Am    Am
All my dreams,
G               Dm7       Am      Am
Pass before my eyes a curiosity.


(chorus)
D/F#  G           Am  Am/G
     Dust in the wind,
D/F#             G           Am
All they are is dust in the wind

(play this alt "*" when Am is said over "wind" at the end of the chorus)


(2nd paragraph)
C    G/bB Am   Am
Same old song,
G               Dm7        Am          Am (play alt "#" instead of the Am's)
Just a drop of water in an endless sea,
C   G/B Am  Am
All we do,
G               Dm7               Am         Am
Crumbles to the ground tho' we refuse to see.


(2nd chorus)
D/F#  G           Am  Am/G
     Dust in the wind,
D/F#           G          Amadd9(x2)  G/A(x2)            F(#11)/A(x2)       F6(#11)/A F(#11)/A
All we are is dust in the wiiii-----iiiiiiiiiiind, oooooooooooh ho hoooooooooo.

(Here there is an instrumental part with the following chords)

Amadd9  Amadd9  G/A  G/A
F(#11)/A  F(#11)/A  F6(#11)/A  F(#11)/A (it is not a mistake, the last chord here is F(#11)/A)
REPEAT THIS ANOTHER TIME

INTRODUCTION AGAIN (with the alteration included)

(and starts the last paragraph)
      C     G/B    Am   Am
(Now) Don't ha-ang o-on,
G                Dm7          Am            Am (play alt "#" instead of the Am's)
Nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky.
    C    G/b  Am    Am
It slips a-awa-a-ay,
    G              Dm7           Am         Am
And all your money won't another minute buy.


(Last chorus)
D/F#  G           Am  Am/G
     Dust in the wind,
D/F#           G           Am                  Am/G
All we are is dust in the wind. (all we are is dust in the wind)
D/F#  G           Am                  Am/G
     Dust in the wind, (everything is dust in the wind)
D/F#           G           Am
Everything is dust in the wind


Instead of this last Am in "wind" keep playing this till the end:
e 0-------0-------0-------|
B 1---1---0---0---3---3---|
G --2---2---2---2---2---2-|
D -2---2---2---2---2---2--|
A 0--0----0--0----0--0----|
E ------------------------|


And that is the end!!! you've finished!!! wasn't it easy?
haha!;)
