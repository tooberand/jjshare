DADG   and you can run, and run some more / from here all the way to singapore
DADD   but i will carry you home in my teeth


DGDG   in the great hall you drink red wine / you chew meat off the bone
DGDG   i beat down the new path to the castle / i come naked and alone
DADG   i laid my son on the bier, i burned the wreath /
         fire overhead, water underneath

The fog is lifting from the water.

The bells are sounding on the boats.
   G    C         G                 Em
And our love is a monster plain and simple.
           G                  D                C
Though you weigh it down with stones to try to drown it,
   D
it floats.
   G
It floats.


G, riff


    G      C            G
The day of reckoning is coming
 G             C            D 
faster than anyone here realizes.
    G   C            G          Em 
And our love is like Jesus, but worse.
           G                D                   C 
Though you seal the cave up where you'd lain its body,

G G C G
G G D D
G G C C
G D C C
G D G G

Bring me something new that I haven't felt before
The messages of love and directions to you door
But please talk slowly, I don't hear good anymore
And we all Fall down
And we all Fall down  

Don't die on me lady, only good things can come 
To those who practice reason and recognize good fun
Your absence is the bullet and the past is your gun 
And we all fall down
And we all fall down

She still doesn't answer though she knows shes done wrong
We buried the memories along with the songs
When she wakes up, I hope that we are gone
And we all fall down
And we all fall down

There's a visitor in black at my neighbors house
My neighbor says tomorrow the visitor says now 
When he comes here please tell him that I'm out
And we all fall down
And we all fall down

Half Dead by the Mountain Goats from CD Get Lonely

B B A E     it was raining outside so i cleaned house today
E B F# F#   spent half of the morning throwing old things away
B B A E     try not to get caught up, try to think like a machine
E B F# F#   focus in on the task, try not to think about what it means

B B E E     can't get you outta my head
B F# B B    lost without you half dead

B B A E     took my spot at the window, looked out at the road
E B F# F#   dots and dashes of traffic like a message in code
B B A E     and whole boxes of memories wrapped up at the curb
E B F# F#   i sang songs to myself, didn't have any words

B B E E     can't get you outta my head
B F# B B    lost without you half dead

B B A E     stole out to the backyard late last night
E B F# F#   pine trees frozen in the silvery moonlight
B B A E     rising like giants from the cold earth
E B F# F#   what are the years we gave eachother ever gonna be worth?

B B E E     can't get you outta my head

The rhythm is pretty easy, so just listen to the song.

Intro:

  D             G             C       G       A
e-------2------------------------------------------------------

Play this through twice, then

Chorus:

A-----------------2-------2---3-------2-------0----------------

Repeat this but then at the A chord, instead of picking it,
just strum it.


Chorus:

Put it in a safe a lock it 'cause it's home sweet home

Verse 1:

             Well you know You keep her in your pocket

Chorus

Verse 2:
Am Am G-D D  The smile on your face made her think she had the right one
Am Am G-D D  Then she thought she was sure / By the way you two could have fun
C C G G      But now she might leave / Like she's threatened before
C C F A      Grab hold of her fast / Before her feet leave the floor
                And she's out the door
             'cause you want To keep her in your pocket

Chorus

Verse 3:
Am Am G-D D  And in your own mind / You know your're lucky just to know her

C C G G      But now you're scared / You think she's running away
C C F A      You search in your hand for something clever to say / Don't go away
             'cause I want To keep you in my pocket

Note:  Standard Tuning.
Use barre chords.  The trick to the sound is to remove your index finger - listen to the rhythm for timing.

Intro:

B D A x2

Verse:

B D   Look beyond the broken bottles
A B   Past the rotting wooden stairs
B D   Root out the wine-dark honeyed center
A E   Not everyone can live like millionaires

B D A B (harmonica)

B D  Look through the air-thin walls
A B  Tear up the floorboards strip the paint
B D  Go over every inch of space
A E  With the patience of a saint

E E B B    Grab your hat get your coat
B D A B    The cellar door is an open throat

B D   Look past the kitchen cabinets
A B   Go through the chest of drawers
B D   Scrutinize the casements
A E   Rip the varnish off the doors

B D   Dig up the laughing photographs
A B   They're here somewhere or other
B D   Take what you can carry
A E   But let me tell you brother

E E B B  Still waters go stagnant / Bodies bloat
B D A B  And the cellar door is an open throat

Ontro:

C#m G# A B   and they came from zimbabwe,  or from soviet georgia.
E G# A B     east saint louis, or from paris, or they lived across the street.
A A B B      but they came, and when they'd FINALLY made it here,
E E A A      it was the least that we could do to make our welcome clear.

Neutral Milk Hotel - The King of Carrot Flowers Pt. 1

F C Bb  (x2)

When you were young you were the king of carrot flowers
and how you built a tower tumbling through the trees
In holy rattlesnakes that fell all 'round your feet

and your mom would stick a fork right into daddy's shoulder
and dad would throw the garbage all across the floor
as we would lay and learn what each other's bodies were for 

F C Bb  (x2)

and this is the room one afternoon I knew I could love you
and from above you how I sank into your soul
into that secret place where no one dares to go 

and your mom would drink until she was no longer speaking
and dad would dream of all the different ways to die
each one a little more than he could dare to try

Intro:  Riff x2

G       On the day that Dennis Brown's lung
C-D     collapsed / Spring rain was misting down on
RIFF    Kingston

G       And down at the harbor local
C-D     cops were intercepting an inbound
RIFF    shipment

C G     And for a while there it was chaos
C D     As they handcuffed and then ruffed up some sailors.
G       On the day my lung collapses
C-D     it's not gonna be that different.
RIFF    different

G     On the day that Dennis Brown's habits
C-D   caught up with him School children sang in
RIFF  choirs.

G     And out behind the Chinese
C-D   restaurants Guys were jumping into
RIFF  dumpsters

C G     And the stench was overbearing
C D     But they were past the point of caring.
G       On the day my habits catch up
C-D     with me, I'll be down among
RIFF    the jumpers.

RIFF    buckshot.


G C-D   And jets of contaminated blood Will cloud the rivers and
RIFF    the lakes.

C G      It took all the coke in town
C D      To bring down Dennis Brown.
G C-D    On the day my lung collapses, we'll see just how much it
RIFF     takes.

you're gonna send me back to where I came from

Please don't send me back to where I came from
      D                              A
Let me go where the white magnolias grow

You're gonna fit me for that orange jumpsuit
Please don't fit me for that orange jumpsuit
Let me ride where the dragonflies glide

Yeah but you're going to do what you wanna do

But I'm not headed southeast from the courthouse
         D                   A
Let some mysterious chunk of space debris
G                     A         
Puncture the roof and set me free

D

And even if I have to go to Claremont
Well I guess I'll just have to go to Claremont
Let me go
Let me lie low


Yeah but you're going to do what you wanna do
No matter what I ask of you
And you send your dark messengers to tempt me
I come from Chino so all your threats are empty

felt sick, felt good

the heat burns, old wood

muscles in my arms pump like machines
Am                       Am7
the jericho palm tree is plush and green

bright sun, the new day
i felt sick in a good way
felt the fever climb when you came down
all the way across town

and you brought me a plate of sweet potatoes

sun fading overhead
the sunset, bright red
your green eyes, your smooth walk
fresh tomato, celery stalk, you cook
pot of pari basmati rice
i felt good, you looked nice
you stood like galatea, over me
fried garlic, kim chee
and you brought me a plate of sweet potatoes

The jacaranda are wet with color,

and the heat is a great paint brush, lending color to our lives,

to the air, and to out faces; but I'm going to Alaska

Up, yes, in the branches,

the purple blossoms, go pale at the edges;

there is moaning in the shifting of the sap, and I see in them traces
G                           D
of last year, but then they hadn't grown so strong,
G                                    C
and their limbs were more like wires. Now they are cables.
G                           D                    G
thick and alive with alien electricity, and I am going to Alaska,
     C                         G
where you can go blind just by looking at the ground,
D
where fat is eaten by itself
C                         G
just to keep your body warm.

G                         C
Because from where we are now, it seems, really,
    G                           D
that everything is growing in a thousand different ways;
G                                        C
that the soil is soaked through with old blood and with relatives
G                                           D
who were buried here, or close to here, and they are giving rise
G                                C
to what is happening. Or can you tell me otherwise?
     G                          D
I am going to Alaska, where the animals can kill you,
        G                     C
but they do so in silence, as though if no-one hears them,
        G                         D
then it really won't matter. I am going to Alaska.
C                                     G
They tell me that it's perfect for my purposes.

And somebody's gonna burst our bubble

Let's go to Maine out on the East Coast
Let's go to Maine right now
Let's beat the retreat
Let's hop on the plane
Let's get out of here
Let's go to Maine

Someone knows what's going on
Someone knows, and someone's gonna tell
Someone's gonna wrap us up in styrofoam and paper
And mail us flat-rate right down to Hell

the moon was high, your smooth face was dry, and the kudzu grew

and the stars fell on alabama

G            D                G
and your eyes filled up with light

G            D            G  C  G    D    G
and the stars fell on alabama

the warm earth underneath us gave way
<dry grass crinkled like paper as a breeze came in across the bay
cold clean water nearby, glimmered in your eyes 
and your pistol glistened.

and the stars fell on alabama
and your eyes filled up with light
and the stars fell on alabama

but if you think i'll take a bullet for you - you're dreaming.

Song: Autoclave
Artist: The Mountain Goats
--tabbed by mike/howardfinkel483

Can switch up the Fs at the 8th fret 5th string shape if you'd like.

C  C/B  Am  G

C            C/B          Am           G
Hand me your hand, let me look in your eyes
      C                    C/B    Am          G
As my last chance to feel human begins to vaporize
C              C/B           Am                 G
Maybe it's the heat in here, maybe it's the pressure
F
You ought to head for the exits, the sooner the better


          C         C/B   Am                 G
I am this great, unstable mass of blood and foam
    C              C/B             Am                G
And no one in her right mind would make my home her home
              F
My heart's an autoclave
              C
My heart's an autoclave

When I try to open up to you I get completely lost
Houses swallowed by the earth, windows thick with frost
And I reach deep down within, but the pathways twist and turn
and there's no light anywhere, and nothing left to burn

And I am this great, unstable mass of blood and foam
And no emotion that's worth having could call my heart its home
My heart's an autoclave
My heart's an autoclave

I dreamt that I was perched atop a throne of human skulls
On a cliff above the ocean, howling wind and shrieking seagulls
And the dream went on forever, one single static frame
Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name

And I am this great, unstable mass of blood and foam
And no one in her right mind would make her home my home
My heart's an autoclave
My heart's an autoclave

I'm writing a song all about you

You've made it pretty clear what you like 
C         C/B              Am7    D
It's only fair to tell you now  

Em           Em7          C       C/B
that I leave early in the morning 
Am7                      D        Dsus  D
and I won't be back till next year  
Em         Em7            C      C/B
I see that kiss-me pucker forming  
Am7                                 D     Dsus  D
but maybe you should plug it with a beer, cause 

CHORUS
G          G/F#    Em                      Em7

G                      G/F#         C                     G
Home was anywhere with diesel gas - Love was a trucker's hand  
G                  G/F#              C         C/B      
Never stuck around long enough for a one night stand 
Am7                           G
Before you kiss me you should know 
C    D         G
Papa was a rodeo 


BRIDGE

( G )| G/F# | Em | Em7 | C   | D - Dsus - D | 

VERSE (1)

The light reflecting off the mirror ball 
looks like a thousand swirling eyes 
They make me think I shouldn't be here at all 
You know, every minute someone dies 


VERSE(2)

What are we doing in this dive bar 
How can you live in a place like this 
Why don't you just get into my car 
and I'll take you away I'll take that kiss now, but 


CHORUS


BRIDGE (X2)


VERSE (2)

And now it's 55 years later 
We've had the romance of the century 
After all these years wrestling gators 
I still feel like crying when I think of what you said to me 


CHORUS

 C    D         G  G/F#
Papa was a rodeo 


OUTRO

Em7       D               C         D     G

Tuning - Standard: EADGBE

Tabbed By: Jeremy Waterman
Contact: jeremysexytime@gmail.com

It may look like some of the chords are placed really strangely, however,
I'm fairly certain everything is in the correct place. I listened through
the whole song to place the chord changes in, but there's still probably
a few small mistakes. As for the chords themselves, they're only basic
chords, but they sound just fine.
The other tab for this, which is what I based mine from, uses C7 instead
of C. If you think that sounds better with this, use that.
C7, in case you wanted to use it, is:
e[--0--]
B[--1--]
G[--3--]
D[--2--]
A[--3--]

Lola
by Ray Davies of the Kinks
Intro:

I m	et her in a club down in old Soho where you 
 	A	D	E	A	Asus4
 	drink champagne and it 	tastes just like cherry 	cola  C-O-L-A 	co	la
 	E
She 	walked up to me and she asked me to dance
 	A	D
I 	asked her her name and in a 	dark brown voice she said  
 	E	A	D	C	D	E
 	Lola  L-O-L-A 	Lola 	  Lo lo lo lo 	Lo - la  	      	

play riff

Well I'm not the world's most physical guy,
but when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine.
You know my Lola Lo Lo Lo Lo Lola
Well I'm not dumb but I can't understand
why she walked like a woman, but talked like a man.
I know my Lola, Lo Lo Lo Lo Lola, Lo Lo Lo Lo Lola
play riff

 	B7
Well we dr	ank champagne and danced all night
 	F#7
 	under electric candle light
 	A
She 	picked me up and sat me on her knee and
 	A
 	 said "pretty boy won't you come home with me?"

Well, I'm not the world's most passionate guy,
but when I looked in her eyes, well I almost fell for my
Lola Lo lo lo lo Lo - la Lo lo lo lo Lo - la
Lola Lo lo lo lo Lo - la Lo lo lo lo Lo - la

play riff
 	A	E	B	A	E	B	A	E	B
I 	pushed 	her a	way I 	walked 	to the 	door  I 	fell 	to the 	floor
 	E	G#7	C#m	B	B13	E
I got 	down 	on my 	knees Then 	I looked at her and she at 	me  	
Well, that's the way that I want it to stay...
I always want it to be that way for my Lola Lo Lo Lo Lo Lola
Girls will be boys and boys will be girls,
It's a mixed up muddled up shook up world,
Except my Lola Lo Lo Lo Lo Lola

Hey and I'd left home just a week before,
And I'd never ever kissed a woman before
Well Lola smiled and took me by the hand,
Said pretty boy, gonna make you a man.

Well I'm not the world's most passionate man,
But I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man and so is Lola.
Lola Lo lo lo lo Lo - la Lo lo lo lo Lo - la
Lola Lo lo lo lo Lo - la Lo lo lo lo Lo - la

You don't have to call me darlin darlin
easy song, great sing along.

CGCC   It was all that I could do  to keep from cryin'
FFCC   sometimes it seems so useless to remain
FFCC   You don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
CGCC   You never even call me by my name.

CGCC   You don't have to call me Waylon Jennings
CGCC   And you don't have to call me Charlie Pride.
FFCAm  You don't have to call me Merle Haggard, anymore.
DDGG   Even though your on my fightin' side.

CHORUS
FFCC   And I'll hang around as long as you will let me
CGCC   And I never minded standin' in the rain.
FFCC   You don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
CGCG   You never even call me by my name.

CGCC   I've heard my name a few times in your phone book
FFCC   I've seen it on signs where I've laid
FFCAm  But the only time I know, I'll hear David Allan Coe
DDGG   Is when Jesus has his final judgement day.

(CHORUS)

CGCC   Well, I was drunk the day my Mom got outta prison.
FFCC   And I went to pick her up in the rain.
FFCAm  But, before I could get to the station in my pickup truck
DDGG   IShe got runned over by a damned old train.

FFCC   So I'll hang around as long as you will let me
CGCC   And I never minded standin' in the rain.
FFCC   You don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
CGCF   You never even call me by my name.
CGFC   Why don't you ever call me by my name.

Give up on trying to save us

And I hope you die 
   Ab                    Db    (back to intro part)
I hope we both die 


I hope I cut myself shaving tomorrow 
I hope it bleeds all day long 
Our friends say it's darkest before the sun rises 
We're pretty sure they're all wrong 
I hope it stays dark forever 
I hope the worst isn't over 
And I hope you blink before I do 


Yeah I hope I never get sober 

And I hope when you think of me years down the line 
You can't find one good thing to say 
And I'd hope that if I found the strength to walk out 
You'd stay the hell out of my way 
I am drowning There is no sign of land
You are coming down with me Hand in unlovable hand 
And I hope you die 
I hope we both die

Pink and Blue

Intro:  E D A B   X2

E D A B      Wind out of Oklahoma this morning
E D A B      Smelled like blood an smoke
E D A B      And the crows discuss their future in the
F# F# A B    branches of their Louisiana Live Oak
E D A B      The limbs are strong and heavy and its
E D A B      Leaves are all aglow
E D A B      And the branches brush the upper air
F# F# A B    But the roots reach down to were the bad people go
A A B B      And what will I do with you,
E E C#m C#m  pink and blue?  True
A A B B      gold.  Nine days old.

E D A B  X3

E D A B      Nice new clothes on you
E D A B      And an old cardboard produce box for a cradle
E D A B      I mashed some bananas in a coffee cup
F# F# A B    And I fed you there at the kitchen table
E D A B      Crows outside complaining about the
E D A B      Finer points of local politics
E D A B      Strange wind all full of new smells
F# F# A B    Rust and fur and reception sticks

Plea From a Cat Named Virtue
Capo 4
Intro:  E A B A E 

E E A A   Why don't you ever wanna play?       I'm tired of this piece of string
B B A E   You sleep as much as I do now,       and you don't eat much of anything
E E A A   I don't know who you're talking to   I made a search through every room
B B A E   but all I found was dust that moved  with shadows of the afternoon

E E    And listen,
A A    about those bitter songs you sing
Fm Fm  they're not helping anything
A A    they won't make you
E E    strong

E E A A    So we should open up the house      invite the tabby two doors down
B B A E    You could ask your sister if        she doesn't bring her basset hound
E E A A    Ask the things you shouldn't miss   tape hiss and the modern man
B B A E    cold war and card catalogues        to come join us if they can
E E A A    For girly drinks and parlor games   we'll pass around the easy lie
B B A E    of absolutely no regrets            and later maybe you could try
E E A A    To let your losses dangle off       the sharp edge of a century
B B A E    We'll talk about the weather or     how the weather use to be

E E    And I'll cater,
A A    with all the birds that I can kill
Fm Fm  let their tiny feathers fill
A A    disappointment
E E    Lie down,
A A    and lick the sorrow from your skin
Fm Fm  Scratch the terror and begin
A A     to believe you're
E E     strong

(SLOWLY)
E E A A    All you ever want to do               is drink and watch TV
E E A A    frankly that thing doesn't really     interest me
E E A A    I swear I'm going to bite you hard    and taste your tinny blood
E E A A    if you don't stop the self-defeating  lies you've been repeating
A A PAUSE  since the day you brought me home     I know you're
E          strong.

D G       you're gonna send me back to where I came from
D G       Please don't send me back to where I came from
D D A A   Let me go where the white magnolias grow

D G       You're gonna fit me for that orange jumpsuit
D G       Please don't fit me for that orange jumpsuit
D D A A   Let me ride where the dragonflies glide

I've got my doubts

I come from Chino where the asphalt sprouts

Big bus headed southeast from the courthouse
D                                 G
But I'm not headed southeast from the courthouse
         D                   A
Let some mysterious chunk of space debris
G                     A         
Puncture the roof and set me free

D

And even if I have to go to Claremont
Well I guess I'll just have to go to Claremont
Let me go
Let me lie low


Yeah but you're going to do what you wanna do
No matter what I ask of you
And you send your dark messengers to tempt me
I come from Chino so all your threats are empty

Song: "Friend is a Four-Letter Word" by Cake
Album: Fashion Nugget

	Its me again.  this song I'm a little less sure about than 'the distance' because I went to the bathroom during this song.  Here goes:

Main Acoustic Riff:

e:I-----------0---------------0---------------1---------
B:I---------1---1-----------1---1-----------1---1-------
G:I-------2-------2-------0-------0-------2-------2-----
D:I-----2-----------2---2-----------2---3-----------3---
A:I---0---------------3---------------------------------
E:I-----------------------------------1-----------------

e:----------2--------I      Repeat this many times, 		
B:--------3---3------I	   listening to the song for
G:------2-------2----I      variations.(At some points,
D:----0-----------0--I      he stays on the A-minor a
A:-------------------I	   few extra times)
E:--2----------------I


Distorted Riff(heard after first verse)

e:I-----------------------------------------I
B:I-----------------------------------------I
G:I-------7-7-6-5-5-------------------------I
D:I--7-7--7-7-6-5-5--5-5-4-3-3--7-7-6-4-4---I
A:I--7-7--5-5-4-3-3--5-5-4-3-3--7-7-6-4-4---I
E:I--5-5-------------3-3-2-1-1--5-5-4-2-2---I

	That's basically the whole song, except for variations of these parts.  Simple, yet cool at the same time.

after each dead chord are upstrokes.

G *C9 D7 D/F#    When you get off work tonight       Meet me at the cnstrctn site
G *C9 D7 D/F#    And we'll write some notes to tape  To the heavy machines

G *C9 D7 D/F#    We hope you get to be               Happy sometimes

C *C D7 D/F#     In a room near a truck stop         On a highway somewhere

G *C9 D7 D/F#    Well you are a radio                You are an open door
G *C9 D7 D/F#    I am a faulty string                Of blue Christmas lights
G *C9 D7 D/F#    You swim through frequencies        You let that stranger in
G *C9 D7 D/F#    As I'm blinking off and on          And off again

C *C G-D/F# Em   And we've got a lot of time         Or maybe we don't
C *C D7 D/F      But I'd like to think so            So let me pretend

G *C9 D7 D/F#    Well these are my favorite chords   I know you like them too
G *C9 D7 D/F#    When I get a new guitar             You could have this one
G *C9 D7 D/F#    And sing me a lullabye              Sing me the alphabet
G *C9 D7 D/F#    Sing me a story I                   Haven't heard yet

                            Am                                  D
now you're eyes aint moving now, they just lay there in their cloud

G B G B   Two headed boy / With pulleys and weights
G B C G   Creating a radio played just for two
C C D D   In the parlor with a moon across her face
C C G G   And through the music he sweetly displays
C C G     Silver speakers that sparkle all day
             C                        Am                                D    C
Made for his lover who's floating and choking with her hands across her face
           G            D             C
And in the dark we will take off our clothes
                        G                  D               C
And they'll be placing fingers through the notches in your spine
                          G               D               C
And when all is breaking, everything that you could keep inside
                            Am                                  D
now you're eyes ain't moving now, they just lay there in their clouououououd


G B G B   Two headed boy / There's no reason to grieve 
G B C G   The world that you need is wrapped in gold silver sleeves
C C D D   Left beneath Christmas trees in the snow
C C G G   And I will take you and leave you alone
C C G     Watching spirals of white softly flow
          C
Over your eyelids and all you did
                                       D
Will wait until the point when you let go
C                G

G Bm C G       Puff, the magic dragon, lived by the sea, 
C G Em-A7 D    and frolicked in the autumn mist in a land calley Honey Lee. 
G Bm C G       Little Jackie Paper loved that rascal Puff, 
C G-Em A7-D G  and brought him string and sealing wax and other fancy stuff. 

(Chorus) 

G Bm C G       Puff, the magic dragon, lived by the sea, 
C G Em-A7 D    and frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honey Lee. 
G Bm C G       Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea 
C G-Em A7-D G  and frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honey Lee. 

G Bm C G       Together they would travel on a boat with billowed sail, 
C G Em-A7 D    Jackie kept a lookout perched on Puff's gigantic tail. 
G Bm C G       Noble kings and princes would bow whenever they came, 
C G-Em A7-D G  pirate ships would lower their flags when Puff roared out his name

(Chorus) 

G Bm C G        A dragon lives forever, but not so little boys, 
C G Em A7 D     painted wings and giant rings make way for other toys. 
G Bm C G        One grey night it happened, Jackie Paper came no more, 
C G Em A7 D G   and Puff, that mighty dragon, he ceased his fearless roar. 

(Chorus) 

G Bm C G        His head was bent in sorrow, green scales feel like rain, 
C G Em A7 D     Puff no longer went to play along the Cherry Lane. 
G Bm C G        Without his life-long friend, Puff could not be brave, 
C G Em A7 D G   so Puff, that mighty dragan, sadly slipped into his cave. 

(Chorus)

Whole Wide World

Lyrics
When I was a young boy
My mama said to me
There's only one girl in the world for you
But she probably lives in Tahiti

I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
Just to find her

Or maybe she's in the Bahamas
Where the Carribean sea is blue
Weeping in a tropical moonlit night
Because nobody's told her 'bout you

I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
Just to find her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
Find out where they hide her

Why am I hanging around in the rain out here
Trying to pick up a girl
Why are my eyes filling up with these lonely tears
When there're girls all over the world

Is she lying on a tropical beach somewhere
Underneath the tropical sun
Pining away in a heatwave there
Hoping that I won't be long

I should be lying on that sun-soaked beach with her
Caressing her warm brown skin
And then in a year or maybe not quite
We'll be sharing the same next of kin

I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
Just to find her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
Find out where they hide her

G D      I'm HEADED down South to the LAND of the pines
Em	C     I'm THUMBIN' my way to NORTH Caroline
G D C C  StaRING up the road and PRAY to God I see HEADLIGHTS  	

G D      I MADE it down the coast in seventeen hours	
Em	C     PICKIN' me a bouquet of DOGWOOD flowers
G D C C  And I'm HOPING for Raleigh; *I* can see my baby TONIGHT  	

(Chorus)

So, ROCK me mama like a WAGON wheel / ROCK me mama any WAY you feel
HEEEEEEEEE EEEEY mama ROCK me    	
ROCK me mama like the wind and THE rain / ROCK me mama like a SOUTH bound train
HEEEEEEEEE EEEEY mama ROCK me    	
 	 	 	
Runnin' from the cold, up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old town string band
My baby plays the guitar; I pick a banjo now

Ahh, the North Country winters keep a gettin' me down
Lost my money playin' poker so I had'a'up and leave town
But I ain't a turning back, to livin' that old life no more

(Chorus)
 	 	 	
Walkin' to the South out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Phillie; had a nice long toke
But he's a headed west from the Cumberland Gap
Johnson City, Tennessee

Now I gotta get a move on, before the sun
I hear my baby callin' my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh, least I will die free

(Chorus)

Dust In The Wind
by: Kansas


This is 100% accurate, i'm completly sure about this!!! There are no mistakes
so try it!

(travis finger picking)
The whole song is played with arpeggio and that's why i thought it is
the first thing to learn from it:
e ---------|
B 0----0---|
G ---0---0-|
D --0---0--|
A 0---0----|
E ---------|
Repeat till you can play it with your eyes closed.

Then the rest is easy.  For the introduction here you have a tip:
trough the introduction the 2nd string (B) makes something like this:
(the arpeggio will aumaticaly do it, you don't have to worry about this)

B 1--0--3
(X6)

But as you play it you wont even notice about it

Then, here are the chords:
          (EADGBe)
C         (x3201x)
Cmaj7     (x3200x)
Cadd3     (x3203x)
Cadd9     (x32030)
Asus2     (x0220x)
Asus4     (x0223x)
Am        (x0221x)
G/B       (x2003x)
G         (3x000x)
Dm7       (xx0211)
D/F#      (2x023x)
Am/G      (3x221x)
Am add9   (x0750x)
G/A       (x0570x)
F(#11)/A  (x0350x)
F6(#11)/A (x0353x)

For G, D/F# and Am/G the arpeggio is played like this:

e -----------|
B 0------0---|
G ---0-----0-|
D --0-----0--|
A -----------|
E 0----0-----|

And for Dm7 it is played like this:

e 0------0---|
B ---0-----0-|
G --0-----0--|
D 0----0-----|
A -----------|
E -----------|

This is the last step:
Right when a paragraph is about to start there is an alteration in the arpeggio:

Example when the first sentence in a paragraph finishes: "#"

  Am             $ C             $ is G/B
e -------------------|
B 1------1--1--1-3-1-|
G ---2-----2--2------|
D --2-----2--2-------|
A 0----0----0--0-2-3-|
E -------------------|

After the introduction it is only: "@"
  Am   $ C (starting the paragraph)
e ---------|
B 1--1-3-1-|
G --2------|
D -2-------|
A 0--0-2-3-|
E ---------|


But after the first Chorus it is played like this: *

  Am                $ C             $ is G/B
e ----------------------|
B 0h1----1----0h1---3-1-|
G -----2----2-----------|
D ----2----2------------|
A -0----0------0----2-3-|
E ----------------------|

And in the instrumental part there is a very little alteration in the arpeggio that
you can practice after you've learned all the song:

  Amadd9  Amadd9  G/A    G/A
e ------------0--------------0---|
B 0---0---0-------0---0--0-------|
G --5---5---5---5---7---7--7---7-|
D -7---7---7---7---5---5--5---5--|
A 0--0----0--0----0--0---0--0----|
E -------------------------------|

*********************************Chords*********************************

For the introduction play:
C Cmaj7 Cadd9 C       Asus2 Asus4 Am Asus2
Cadd9 C Cmaj7 Cadd9   Am Asus2 Asus4 Am (in the last Am play alt "@")

Dm7       (xx0211)
D/F#      (2x023x)
Am/G      (3x221x)

(1st paragraph)
    C   G/B Am     Am
I close my eyes,
G           Dm7            Am               Am
Only for a moment and the moment's gone. (alt "#" instead of both Am)
C   G/B   Am    Am
All my dreams,
G               Dm7       Am      Am
Pass before my eyes a curiosity.


(chorus)
D/F#  G           Am  Am/G
     Dust in the wind,
D/F#             G           Am
All they are is dust in the wind

(play this alt "*" when Am is said over "wind" at the end of the chorus)


(2nd paragraph)
C    G/bB Am   Am
Same old song,
G               Dm7        Am          Am (play alt "#" instead of the Am's)
Just a drop of water in an endless sea,
C   G/B Am  Am
All we do,
G               Dm7               Am         Am
Crumbles to the ground tho' we refuse to see.


(2nd chorus)
D/F#  G           Am  Am/G
     Dust in the wind,
D/F#           G          Amadd9(x2)  G/A(x2)            F(#11)/A(x2)       F6(#11)/A F(#11)/A
All we are is dust in the wiiii-----iiiiiiiiiiind, oooooooooooh ho hoooooooooo.

(Here there is an instrumental part with the following chords)

Amadd9  Amadd9  G/A  G/A
F(#11)/A  F(#11)/A  F6(#11)/A  F(#11)/A (it is not a mistake, the last chord here is F(#11)/A)
REPEAT THIS ANOTHER TIME

INTRODUCTION AGAIN (with the alteration included)

(and starts the last paragraph)
      C     G/B    Am   Am
(Now) Don't ha-ang o-on,
G                Dm7          Am            Am (play alt "#" instead of the Am's)
Nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky.
    C    G/b  Am    Am
It slips a-awa-a-ay,
    G              Dm7           Am         Am
And all your money won't another minute buy.


(Last chorus)
D/F#  G           Am  Am/G
     Dust in the wind,
D/F#           G           Am                  Am/G
All we are is dust in the wind. (all we are is dust in the wind)
D/F#  G           Am                  Am/G
     Dust in the wind, (everything is dust in the wind)
D/F#           G           Am
Everything is dust in the wind


Instead of this last Am in "wind" keep playing this till the end:
e 0-------0-------0-------|
B 1---1---0---0---3---3---|
G --2---2---2---2---2---2-|
D -2---2---2---2---2---2--|
A 0--0----0--0----0--0----|
E ------------------------|


And that is the end!!! you've finished!!! wasn't it easy?
haha!;)

It's got bums when it's cold like any other place
                A7
It's warm up inside
  Em                            A7

Where the place I catch my ride most everyday

Hallelujah

[Introduction]  C// Am// C// Am//

     C                 Am
I've heard there was a secret chord
     C                   Am
That David played and it pleased the Lord
    F                G              C      G7
But you don't really care for music do you

   C                   F           G
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
    Am              F
The minor fall, the major lift
    G               Em           Am
The baffled King composing Hallelujah

     F           Am
Hallelujah, hallelujah
     F           C G C    G7
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah

Maybe I've been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah

There was a time when you let me know
What's real and going on below?
But now you never show it to me, do you
Remember when I moved in you
The Holy Dark was moving too
And every breath we drew was hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah


Maybe there's a God above
And all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you?
And it's not a cry you can hear at night
It's not someone who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah


This follows the Rufus Wainwright piano version of the tune and
can be capo'd to suit individual's voice range

Take your carriage clock and shove it.

Intro: F# C# F# C# F# C# G#

C# G# F# C#
F# C# G# G#

In the boardroom the quiet man takes a second to think what to do;
He's out of his seat and he's starting to speak and he hears his own voice;
For years and years he's done nothing but bear down, /
	 and put up with all their demands;
She sits like a viper and offers a clock without giving a damn...He takes it;
"Honour forbids me, but honour be damned, /
	you have wined till you got what you want;
I did the work and when things were going badly you left us to rot";

Bridge: F# C# F# C# F# C# G# G#

He locks the door of the boardroom and turns, /
	like the scene from the old country song;
Towering over the table he is lost; he is drunk with it all:
"You only came back to us when we'd turned it around, /
	when we'd rescued your arse from the fire;
Your contribution to all that we did is to say it was dire"

Bridge

(one strum)
"Night after day after night I've been working, despite of you fucking us all;
Now I'm going to die, I don't care if you cry, just please leave me alone;
(normal)
And spare those tears for yourself, we've had those 'till we're sick, /
	 you should leave while you still the chance";
(F# C# F# C#)  The others were shocked at this shameful display /
	at the end of an hounoured career;
He paused in the silence to pull down his tie and observe the melee.


Given that these are all sharp chords, they can be played barre style, or open on capo one; whichever 
better to your ear.

Another turning point a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist directs you where to go
So make the best of this test and don't ask why
It's not a question but a lesson learned in time
It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

So take the photographs and still frames in your mind.
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time.
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial.
Through what its worth it was worth all the while
It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right,
I hope you had the time of your life.

So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth it was worth all the while

It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right,
I hope you had the time of your life. 

It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right,
I hope you had the time of your life. 

It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right,
I hope you had the time of your life.

Well, it's 3AM again, like it always seems to be
C                  G             Am              G   F
Driving northbound, driving homeward, driving wind is driving me.
C                 G               Am    G        F
and It just seems so funny how I always end up here
C                  G            Am      G       F
Walking outside in a storm while looking way up past the treeline
G
It's been some time

Give me shoes that weren't made for standing.

give me a bedtime just sometimes

Well, it's 3AM again, like it always seems to be
Driving northbound, driving homeward, driving wind is driving me.
and It just seems so funny how I always end up here
Walking outside in a storm while looking way up past the treeline
It's been some time

Give me darkness when I'm dreaming, give me moonlight when I'm leaving,
Give me shoes that weren't made for standing.
Give me treeline, give me big sky, give me snowbound, give me rainclouds,
give me a bedtime just sometimes

Now you're talking in my room, there ain't nobody here
Cause I've been driving like a trucker, I've been wearing through the gears
I've been training like a soldier, I've been burning through this sorrow
The only talking lately is a background radio

   You are my friend and I was the same
   Riding that hope was like catching some train
   Well now I just walk, well I don't mind the rain
   But I've been singing so much softer than I did back then

the night, I think, is darker than we can really say,
God's been living in that ocean, sending us all the big waves
And I wish I was a sailor so I could know just how to trust
Maybe I could bring some grace back home to dry land for all of us

Say what you see, you say it so well
Just say you will wait like snow on the rail
Combing that train yard for some kind of sign
Even my own self, it just don't seem mine

Give me darkness when I'm dreaming, give me moonlight when I'm leaving
Give me mustang horse and muscle, 'cause I won't be going gentle
Give me slant-eye looks when I'm lying, give me fingers when I'm crying
I ain't out there to cheat you, see I killed that damn coyote in me

I drink to remember, I smoke to forget
Some things to be proud of, some stuff to regret
Been down some dark alleys, in my own head
Something is changing, changing, changing.

I go back to Clifton to see my old friends
The best people I could ever have met
Skin up a fat one, hide from the Feds
Something is changing, changing, changing.

So I kiss goodbye to every little ounce of pain
Light a cigarette and wish the world away
I got out I got out out alive and I'm here to stay

So I hold two fingers up to yesterday
Light a cigarette and smoke it all away
I got out, I got out, out alive and I'm here to stay

Down in the kitchen drinking white lightning
He's with my momma, yelling and fighting
It's not the first time praying for silence
Something is changing, changing, changing

If I get murdered in the city / Don't go revenging in my name
One person dead from such is plenty / No need to go get locked away
When I leave your arms / The things I think of
No need to get over alarmed, / I'm coming home

I wonder which brother is better / Which one our parents loved the most
I sure did get in lots of trouble / They seemed to let the other go

A tear fell from my father's eyes
I wondered what my dad would say
He said I love you
And I'm proud of you both, in so many different-

If I get murdered in the city / Go read the letter in my desk
Don't bother with all my belongings / Pay attention to the list

Make sure my sister knows I loved her
Make sure my mother knows the same
Always remember, there is nothing worth sharing
Like the love that let us share our name
Always remember, there is nothing worth sharing
Like the love that let us share our name

Finish with a strong C

(CC)Love writes a letter and (G)sends it to (C)hate.
My (FFF)vacations ending. I'm coming home (C)late.
The (F)weather was (G)fine and the (C)ocean was (Am)great
and I (C)can't wait to (G)see you (FF)again.

Hate reads the letter and throws it away.
"No one here cares if you go or you stay.
I barely even noticed that you were away.
I'll see you or I won't, whatever."

Love sings a song as she sails through the sky.
The water looks bluer through her pretty eyes.
And everyone knows it whenever she flies,
and also when she comes down.

Hate keeps his head up and walks through the street.
Every stranger and drifter he greets.
And shakes hands with every loner he meets
with a serious look on his face.

Love arrives safely with suitcase in tow.
Carrying with her the good things we know.
A reason to live and a reason to grow.
To trust. To hope. To care.

Hate sits alone on the hood of his car.
Without much regard to the moon or the stars.
Lazily killing the last of a jar
of the strongest stuff you can drink.

Love takes a taxi, a young man drives.
As soon as he sees her, hope fills his eyes.
But tears follow after, at the end of the ride,
cause he might never see her again.

Hate gets home lucky to still be alive.
He screams o'er the sidewalk and into the drive.
The clock in the kitchen says 2:55,
And the clock in the kitchen is slow.

Love has been waiting, patient and kind.
Just wanting a phone call or some kind of sign,
That the one that she cares for, who's out of his mind,
Will make it back safe to her arms.

Hate stumbles forward and leans in the door.
Weary head hung, eyes to the floor.
He says "Love, I'm sorry", and she says, "What for?
I'm your and that's it, Whatever.
I should not have been gone for so long.
I'm yours and that's it, forever."

You're mine and that's it, forever.



  F               G    C        B/C  Am
I should not have been gone for so   long.
    C                 G   F
I'm yours and that's it, forever."
       C               G   F
You're mine and that's it, forever.

VERSE 1:     

G    You are a splendid butterfly
Em   It is your wings that make you beautiful
D    And I could make you fly away
G    But I could never make you stay

G    You said you were in love with me
Em   Both of us know that that's impossible
D    And I could make you rue the day
G    But I could never make you stay
                       
CHORUS:           
D    Not for all the tea in China
G    Not if I could sing like a bird
D    Not for all North Carolina
G    Not for all my little words

D    Not if I could write for you
G    The sweetest song you ever heard
D    It doesn't matter what I'll do
G    Not for all my little words

VERSE 2 (tablature the same as verse 1)

G    Now that you've made me want to die
Em   You tell me that you're unboyfriendable
D    And I could make you pay and pay
G    But I could never make you stay

Sorry, no tabs on this one. Figured it out by ear. Though it's
fairly simple. Essentially: verse chords = G (add C on 2nd
string, then back to open B), e minor (add C on 2nd string, then
back to open B), then D (with that little riff), C, and
G. Chorus chords = G, D (with riff), C. If you want to play
along with the CD, then it's capo on the 1st fret (key of
Ab). For this vid, I tuned down a whole step (DGCFAD = key of F
for this song). Cheers

Bella - Angus and Julia Stone

Tuning: Standard

Capo 1. Though, in some live versions, his guitar is tuned down
half a step - same as no capo on a standard tuned guitar.

Main chords:
-Aadd9: 002420
-Unsure of the name, A1: 020220 
-E: 022100
-Unsure of the name, A2: 200220
-Unsure of the name, A3: 050230 (if it is too hard to put your pinky on the 5th 
fret of the A string, 000230 sounds fine)
-A: 002220

During the verse, it's the same picking pattern as above using
chords Aadd9 then A1, with random hammer ons every no and then,
listen to the song or that, they're easy to find.

End verse with:

A|---------------|---------------|--5------5------|--5-----5--------|
E|--0-----0------|--2-----2------|----------------|-----------------|

Repeat that last bar 5 times, during "...I hope all is well.."



***Repeat everything twice but end last verse with Aadd9 and A1
played twice instead of 4 times and no chorus.

***End the whole song by downward strumming Aadd9.

IN SOME LIVE VERSIONS:

-Angus plays slower with another pluck of the G string in the
picking pattern, but it sounds fine as written above and this is
how it's played on the album version.

Lyrics:

Verse 1

There goes the gal
In the pretty skirt with the
Golden smile that made you feel new
Like when the marching band strolls the street
You know another years come too soon
So you took her hand and she gave a look that sent you to the moon
And there you spoke the words of a gentleman
Can I have this dance with you
Can I share this dance with you

Chorus

Won't you come on home
I built us a flying machine
And we'll go where you want
and we'll sail the seven seas
I hope all is well in daisys dreams

Verse 2

There goes the gal
Yeah the pretty bird on the golden mile that made you feel real
She took withon to the stars
She don't make no big deal
There she sits with them big old fields of daisies and rusted mills
And when the sun it shines on her hair of gold
She's beautiful
She's beautiful

Chorus

Won't you come on home
I built us a flying machine
And well go where you want well sail the seven seas
I hope all is well in daisys dreams

Da de de da da

Freight train, freight train, run so fast
Freight train, freight train, run so fast
Please don't tell what train I'm on
They won't know what route I'm going

When I'm dead and in my grave
No more good times here I crave
Place the stones at my head and feet
And tell them all I've gone to sleep

When I die, oh bury me deep
Down at the end of old Chestnut Street
So I can hear old Number Nine
As she comes rolling by

When I die, oh bury me deep
Down at the end of old Chestnut Street
Place the stones at my head and feet
And tell them all I've gone to sleep

Freight train, freight train, run so fast
Freight train, freight train, run so fast
Please don't tell what train I'm on
They won't know what route I'm going

chorus: for the chorus I just use a random picking pattern 
        that keeps with the beat using the chords G C Am and D

G                                               C
and through the glass, the corn crows come like rain

they wont stay, they wont stay for

Notes:

*Capo 2

*Picking pattern in the Intro continues throughout the song

*Release D string on all transitions from Em to C/G (see how it happens in the Intro)

*Numbers in parentheses signify chord duration in bass note counts (i.e., for "G (8)," 
pick the G chord for 8 counts of the lowest note, like in the beginning of the Intro)

*A plus sign (+) in the parenthesis means continue for the given number of counts (i.e., 
for "Em (8) Em (+8)," pick the Em chord for a total of 16 continuous counts)

C/G (8)                          G (8)  Em (8)
Where were you when I was still kind

Em (+8)
Just a water treader
C/G (8)         G (8)  Em (8)
Waiting on the line

Em (+8)
Just a dry gin drinker
C/G (8)       G (8)  Em (8)
Master and a hound

Em (+8)
Turned a circus swinger
C/G (8)            G (8)
Look, he's coming down
D/F# (16)
Down

        C/G (8)
Can you shake it up
     G (8)
Just once for me
     Em (8)               C/G (16)
Your little globe just so we can see
                  G (8)      D/F# (16)
The snow blowing round your hands

        C/G (8)
And the wing-nut turned
              G (8)
The song that we both know
        Em (8)           C/G (16)
Sent us flying round the carnival
                       G (8)          D/F# (16)
You can throw all your lucky coins on me

C/G (8)  G (8)  D/F# (8)  Em (8)  C/G (8)  G (8)  D/F# (8)  C/G (8)
On me

         C               G              Am         /g
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
F                       C        G
Iff'n you don't know by now
       C               G              Am         /g
An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
D7/f#              G  (G6-G7)
It'll never do somehow

          C                    C7
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
F                        D7/f#
Look out your window and I'll be gone
       C   G          Am   /g   F
You're the reason I'm trav'lin' on
    C           G            C
But don't think twice, it's alright

       C               G               Am         /g
An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
F                 C          G
The light I never knowed
       C               G               Am         /g
An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
D7/f#                       G  (G6-G7)
I'm on the dark side of the road
      C                                  C7
Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
F                            D7/f#
To try and make me change my mind and stay
   C     G            Am   /g    F
We never did too much talkin' anyway
    C           G            C
But don't think twice, it's alright

      C               G              Am         /g
So it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
F                   C          G
Like you never done before
       C               G               Am         /g
An' it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
D7/f#               G  (G6-G7)
I can't hear you anymore
      C                        C7
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' walkin' down the road
F                       D7/f#
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
  C           G             Am   /g       F
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
    C           G            C
But don't think twice, it's alright

C  G           Am    /g
So long, honey babe
F                        C       G
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
C          G          Am       /g
Goodbye is too good a word, babe
   D7/f#                   G  (G6-G7)
So I'll just say fare thee well
  C                        C7
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
F                              D7/f#
You could have done better but I don't mind
C                     G  Am       /g   F
You just kinda wasted my precious time
    C           G            C
But don't think twice, it's alright

Enjoy!

LYRICS

INTRO

    G (with riff)

VERSE

          G 
    I was watching 
             C 
    With one eye on the other side
          D 
    I had fifteen people telling me to move
          G 
    I got moving on my mind

    I found shelter
    In some thoughts turning wheels around
    I said 39 times that I love you
    To the beauty that I had found

CHORUS

                  G 
        Well, its one two three four take the elevator
               C 
        At the Hotel Yorba I'll be glad to see ya later
       D                            G-> F-> G 
        All they got inside is vacancy...   (hey!)

    (verse chords x1)

    I've been thinking
    Of a little place down by the lake
    They got a dirty old road leading up to the house
    I wonder how long it will take

    'Till we're alone
    Sitting on the front porch of that home
    Stomping our feet on the wooden floors
    Never gotta worry about locking the doors

        Well, its one two three four take the elevator
        At the Hotel Yorba I'll be glad to see ya later
        All they got inside is vacancy
    
    (verse chords x1, let ring)

    (let chords ring)
    It might sound silly
    For me to think childish thoughts like this
    But I'm so tired of acting tough
    And I'm gonna do what I please

    (back to normal strumming)
    Let's get married
    In a big cathedral by a priest
    Cause if I'm the man that you love the most
    You could say "I do" at least

        Well, its one two three four take the elevator
        At the Hotel Yorba I'll be glad to see ya later
       D                            G 
        All they got inside is vacancy

        And its four five six seven grab your umbrella
        A-grab a hold of me cause I'm you better fella
       D                            G   C   G -> D -> G (let ring)
        All they got inside is vacancy

NOTES & TABS

Guitar Chords Used

Here is how you play the guitar chords used in this song. Pretty damn straightforward. You can throw in an Am7 if you like, in place of the Am chord (leave the G string open, and/or add your pinky to the 3rd fret of the high E chord). Otherwise, there is room for feeling in this one -- don't feel too boxed in and just roll with it.

Did you know you can use this same fingerpicking pattern when
playing the guitar? Did you know that ukulele chords are very
similar to those of the guitar? (Playing the uke is like playing
the guitar with a capo on the fifth fret, except with two fewer
strings.)

I came to see you up there in intensive care
They had handcuffed you to your bed
There were tubes going into you and out from you
Bright white gauze bandages at your head

I am a mole
Sticking his head above the surface of the earth
I am a mole
Sticking his head above the surface of the earth

And they said "Lights out"
And it was lights out
And they gave you your medication
I know what you want and you know what I want

Out in the desert we'll have no worries
Out in the desert just you and me
I came to see you up there in intensive care
Out in the desert we'll live carefree

======================================================================
A quick note on chords.  The actual name of the Fmaj7* is Fmaj7b5, which looks like this:

e| 0
B| 1
G| 2
D| 3
A| 0
E| x

As played here, you could call them C-Cmaj7-C (without a 3rd/5th for the C and no 3rd 
for the Cmaj7) and F5-Fdim-F5 (no b3rd for the Fdim).

As they're plucked here, it's easier to just make the C/Fmaj7 shape respectively and 
lift up your index finger for the major 7th.  That also allows you to do John Darnielle's 
cool little extra bits.  You can also choose to pluck the G string with a third finger.

Here's the progression.  These progression is fingerpicked.
e|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
B|---1--0--1----1--0--1----1--0--1----1--0--1-------------------------------|
G|--(0)(0)(0)--(2)(2)(2)--(0)(0)(0)--(0)(0)(0)------------------------------|
D|--------------3--3--3-----------------------------------------------------|
A|---3--3--3---------------3--3--3----3--3--3-------------------------------|
E|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Simple enough, right?  Sir Darnielle throws in little flourishes that shouldn't be too 
hard to do.  Just keep making that C-esque shape and pluck around some of the other 
strings too.  If you can figure out a single note run that sounds good, do it.

There were tubes going into you and out from you,

Bright white gauze bandages at your head.

I am a mole,

Sticking his head above the surface of the earth.

And they said "Lights out!",

And it was lights out.

Minnesota Tab

I just tried to edit the existing tab, which was close to correct
but has a few problems.  The biggest thing is that it was missing 
the Am during the chorus part, and just had a C.  You can hear he
does a walkdown on the A string from C to Am.

The D* means play a normal D but hammer on and off on the G string 
a couple of times.  You also dont have to... I think it was labelled 
a Dsus in the other tab but I don't think that's correct.

Also I find the C sounds good if you play C9 - which makes for 
an easier transition too.

C9 = 3

   seeds came in the mail today from holland
         D*                              C
and the language on the package was wonderful and strange
G                         Em 
all sorts of flowers that grow up from the earth
   D*                      C
      in goodly colors gloriously arranged

C                           D  
i circled the house and i scattered them around
        G                        C
let the water sink down into the soil
Am                           D  
   stared a long time at the residue
G                  C
   blood, milk and oil
Am                           D  
god the humidity is something
G                  C
our shirts are soaked clean through
Am                           D  
the house is throbbing and the heat keeps coming
G                  C
and i keep looking at you

G   Em   Dsus   C    

G                              Em 
    and then you're singing in dutch to me
         D*                        C
            and i recognize the song
G                      Em 
   it seems so old and so fragile 
D*                              C
   and i haven't heard it in so long
Am                                 D  
   we may throw the windows open later
           G                      C
but we are not as far west as you suppose we are
Am                       D  
hot wind coming off the water
G                        C
the sky gone crazy with stars
Am                      D  
while we stay here we imagine we're alive
G                      C
we see shadows on the walls
Am                                       D  
there's something waiting for us in the hot, wet air
G                 C
sweat, water and alcohol


         G 
just the old blood
D*              
rising up through the wooden floor again
G 
just the old love
C
asking for more again 

G Em D* C (x2)
